The firm’s sales team received 9 customer complaints (October 2018 — March 2020) regarding leaking or broken container closure systems. None of the 9 complaints were  investigated despite 2 of them occurring after the sales team was trained on the customer complaint procedure.

Specifically, the firm’s environmental monitoring practices of classified and aseptic processing areas do not ensure appropriate levels of environmental cleanliness. For example:  A. The firm failed to conduct investigations of environmental excursions to include microbial species identification and perform corrective and preventive actions following identification of objectionable microbes recovered from classified environments such as additional sporicidal cleanings. For example, on 9/25/2019, the firm recovered airborne mold from two locations in ISO-8 room 300 (the firm’s (B) (4) ) and airborne mold from 3 locations in ISO-7 room 302 (the firm’s (b) (4)  ); however, the firm failed to initiate an EEI, only performed microbial species identification for 2 of the 5 mold recoveries (Talaromyces wortmannii and Irpex lacteus, both filamentous fungi), and failed to perform corrective actions such as additional sporicidal cleanings.  B. Objectionable microorganisms such as mold and fungus are not identified to species level. For example, from 9/1/18 to 3/11/20 a total of 294 environmental monitoring sample recoveries from classified environments were phenotypically identified as mold or fungus and documented by the firm’s staff; however, only 270 of these recoveries were microbially identified to species level.  C. Not all ISO-5 microbial recoveries are identified and investigated. The firm does not perform microbial species identification on all recoveries found on operator’s sleeves unless the recovery is CFUs. Operator’s sleeves were observed to routinely enter ISO-5 environments during the inspection. From 4/1/19 to 12/31/19, the firm failed to conduct investigations including microbial species identification on 73 microbial recoveries from operator’s sleeves and it is unknown if these recoveries represent objectionable organisms such as spore formers.  D. The firm’s environmental monitoring practices of the il (b) (4)iaminar flow hoods” @ FH) located in the firm’s ISO-7 Clean Room 202 are not supported by scientific justification for sampling locations. For example, the stainless-steel decks of the LFHs ((b) (4) in dimension) are perforated with approximately (b) (4) diameter holes except for an approximate (B) (4)-wide non-perforated strip of stainless-steel surface located in the center of the deck. The firm was observed to perform surface sampling of the perforated portion of the VLFH deck instead of the uniform portion of the deck, therefore not allowing for complete contact of sample media to the deck surface.  E. The firm lacks scientific rationale for environmental monitoring alert and action levels. For example, the firm’s ISO-7 surface sampling alert level is ™@ CFUs and action level is” CFUs, and the firm’s ISO-7 viable air alert level is ’CFUs and action level is” CFUs. In addition, the firm does not perform EEIs to include microbial species identification (firm personnel morphologically identify mold and or fungus) and corrective actions for ISO-7 microbial recoveries unless the recovery is ()4) CFUs for surface sampling o1!®) @) CFUs for viable air sampling. It is unknown if these recoveries represent objectionable organisms.  F.

Based on the firm’s investigation, the root cause does not seem to be related to the operation of (5)MAYH Water System or method used for testing and it was more likely that the sample was contaminated during collection / transportation. It was noted that the on-line TOC readings were above specification on multiple days between 6/13/2019 and 7/26/2019 as detailed under observation 1(2A). These excursions were not evaluated in the investigation, LAB-00046. No CAPA was proposed.

Based upon further spectra studies utilizing a (BMH detector, the site concluded the spectra of the extraneous peak matches with the spectra of Acetaminophen.  In LAB 00051, the site identified contaminated glassware as the potential root cause; however, the investigation does not explain how a single contaminated pipette can produce extraneous peaks with different peak areas in some samples but not others.

The firm introduced Methylphenidate Chewable Tablets in 2015 to the facility. However, an evaluation on MAC limits was never performed prior to the introduction of this product. In May 2020, the firm realized that Methylphenidate Chewable Tablets should be considered as the “worst case product” from a cleanability perspective.

For example, observation of routine actions conducted by Technicians in the controlled areas were not documented as part of the investigation, nor were there any documented investigations of air patterns (e.g., turbulence and/or dead air in the clean rooms) that may have lead to the excursions.

Products aseptically filled on this line include but are not limited to Ramucirumab, Glucagon, (b) (4) , Olaratumab.(b) (4) ', (b) (4) , Bamlanivimab, and Etesevimab. Specifically,  A. Media Fills 1.

They stated they do not consider the time the operator is working in the aseptic B103 vial filling line during the fatigue challenge, instead the monitor the length of the operators shift, regardless of where they are working. As performed by the firm, the fatigue challenge does not ensure the operator maintains aseptic technique even when they are fatigued.  B. Aseptic Processing  1. SOP 001-005056 General Aseptic Practices and Techniques for Parenteral Filling and Manufacturing Operations, v22, dated 12/16/19, section 5.7.2 states “All aseptic personnel must use the appropriate (©) @) terminal within the aseptic area to log in and log out from the areas identified within the applicable (b) (4) ”. Management stated they use an electronic entry/exit log for tracking the number of people who work in the B103 aseptic vial line, however they do not use this electronic system to reconcile who is in the room during production. This log is not controlled. Operators can make adjustments to this log to alter the number of persons in the room when people forget to log in/out. What is documented in the batch record does not correlate to what is listed in the electronic log. For example:  a.

Environmental Monitors are not logged into the electronic entry/exit log, even though they are in the aseptic area and performing EM on the line.  2. Not all activities performed in the aseptic area are documented. The firm does not document who and when aseptic manipulations are performed (i.e. addition of stoppers, environmental monitoring).  3. The firm did not have scientific justification for removing some coded interventions from their (b) (4) system used to document interventions during production. These interventions were still occurring (although at low frequency). No rational could be provided as to why interventions occurring less frequent were kept while some interventions occurring at higher frequencies were removed.  4.

In addition, the firm rejected the” PV batch(b) (4) when potency values (for Prednisolone Acetate) were found OOS for samples representing (b) (4) the batch.

(REPEAT OBSERVATION)  Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile are not established: Specifically,  A) The media fill performed does not represent the number and complexity of routine and nonroutine interventions that occur during production of commercial sterile injectable products.  B) A procedure is not established to. determine the number of open vials inside the(b) (4) system to be rejected after a filling equipment downtime or nonroutine intervention.

Throughout the 57 minute downtime there were various interventions performed by the mechanic and operator inside the ISO 5(b) (4) system. The firm’s procedure does not require the operators to account or document the type and complexity of interventions performed during a filling run.
