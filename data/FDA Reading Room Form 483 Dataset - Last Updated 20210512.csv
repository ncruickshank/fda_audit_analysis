DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1

There is a failure to thoroughly review the failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its
specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

Specifically,

A. Testosterone 100mg (Lot# 03182020TN

© mplantable hormonal pellets intended to be sterile, failed

sterility testing for Chaetomium globosum (fungus) after (b) (4) _ sterilization from your third-party
contract testing laboratory. Your quality unit noted an 81% recovery of Chaetominm globosum over the
last 30 months, with an increasing frequency over the last 12 months. In addition, a third-party janitorial
company concluded, “the HVAC system including the(b) (4) the air returns, walls,
ceilings, and floors of the suite were all contaminated with mold.” Your firm’s quality unit failed to
conduct a thorough investigation to address the source of this contamination. For example, but not limited
to, your firm’s Vice President of Quality Assurance stated on 09/02/2020, a third-party contractor
performed cleanings to eradicate your firm’s fungus/mold concerns. However, Chaetomium globosum
was recovered at your facility on 10/07/2020.

According to your firm’s investigation report, provided by your firm’s Vice President of Quality
Assurance, various fungus species have been recovered on several occasions between 2018-2020. For

OBSERVATION 2
Buildings used in the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of a drug product do not have the
suitable construction to facilitate cleaning, maintenance, and proper operations.

***THIS IS A REPEAT OBSERVATION FROM FDA 483 issued in 2018 (Observation 7)***

Specifically, your firm has structural and equipment deficiencies in the classified areas which do not ensure clean
air flow, including, but are not limited to:

A. In your firm’s ISO 7-1 package room and ISO 7-2 pellet room where implantable hormonal pellets
intended to be sterile are produced, we observed the following:

a.
b.

Gaps around the perimeter of your firm’s ceiling HEPA filter screens and
Excess caulking located on the ceiling that is not smooth and not easily cleanable.

B. In your firm’s ISO 7-1 package room, the light fixtures are not smooth and are not easily cleanable.

C. Your firm’s(b) (4) Preventative Maintenance Report, dated 11/18/2020, performed by a third-
party contractor, documents your facility has (b) (4) . that have excessive rust damage.
Your firm’s Vice President of Quality Assurance provided a schematic of your facility’s HV AC
system and stated the (b) (4) referred to in this report are located above your firm’s Pellet Suite.

Please refer to OBSERVATION 4 for additional Quality Unit concerns.

OBSERVATION 3
Equipment and utensils are not maintained at appropriate intervals to prevent contamination that would
alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product.

Specifically, on 12/01/2020, we observed obvious surface abrasions located on the faceplate of your firm's pellet
press, EQOOL, that come in direct contact with drug components during processing for implantable hormonal
pellets intended to be sterile. Your firm’s Vice President of Quality Assurance explained production operators
would note equipment damages on your firm’s batch record. However, your firm’s written procedures for batch
records do not address the documentation of equipment concerns. In addition, your firm’s batch records do not
have an allocated space for equipment concerns. Furthermore, your firm’s written procedures for the preventative
maintenance of the pellet press do not address the visual inspection of the pellet press for damages prior to

production.

Your firm produced and released at least ® lots (approximately (b) (4) implantable sterile hormonal pellets) on
EQ001 that are within expiry.

Please refer to OBSERVATION 4 for additional Quality Unit concerns.

OBSERVATION 4
The quality control unit lacks responsibility to approve and reject all procedures or specifications
impacting on the identity, strength, quality and purity of drug products.

*** THIS IS A REPEAT OBSERVATION FROM FDA 483 issued in 2018 (Observation 2)***

Specifically, during an interview with your firm’s Quality Assurance Supervisor, who is onsite daily, is
responsible for, but not limited to: review and release of your firm’s batch records; routine monitoring reviews;
and oversees your firm’s environmental monitoring program, stated they do not make quality decisions due to
lack of experience or authority. For example, but not limited to:

A. On 12/07/2020, your firm’s Quality Assurance Supervisor stated they acknowledged the gaps in your
firm's ISO 7-2 Packaging Room and ISO 7-1 Pellet Room ceilings and stated these gaps may cause
disruption in the quality of air. However, the Quality Assurance Supervisor does not review your firm’s
cleanroom certification reports and explained this review was conducted by the Quality Unit located in
Ocala, Florida. Your firm’s Director of Operations stated the Vice President of Quality Assurance,
located in Ocala, Florida, visits their facility approximately (b) (4) and the Senior Quality
Assurance Manager, also located in Ocala, Florida visits approximately (b) (4) -

B. On 12/01/2020, we observed obvious surface abrasions located on the faceplate of your firm's pellet
press, EQOO01, that comes in direct contact with drug components during processing for implantable
hormonal pellets that are intended to be sterile. On 12/01/2020 and 12/07/2020, your firm’s Quality
Assurance Supervisor, who routinely reviews and authorizes the release of batch records, stated your firm
did not have any assurances currently in place that would ensure the implantable hormonal pellets
produced on EQ001 and released to the public were not free of metal inclusions (e.g., no metal detection
devices). However, your firm’s Quality Assurance Supervisor, stated they lack the authority to initiate an
investigation (deviation) and defers to the Quality Unit located in Ocala, Florida for such determinations.
On 12/10/2020, your firm’s Director of Operations provided a dispensing, report documenting at least 0

lots (approximately (b) (4) implantable hormonal pellets) within expiry were distributed to the public. As
of 12/10/2020, your firm's Vice President of Quality Assurance (located in Ocala, Florida) stated they
were “still determining whether or not this constitutes a deviation due to a surface abrasion”. Please refer
to OBSERVATION 3 for additional details.

OBSERVATION 5
Complaint records are deficient in that they do not include the findings of the investigation and follow-

up.

Specifically,

A. Your firm received a complaint involving hospitalization and sepsis after a patient received Estradiol 6mg
(Lot #05282019TN® Testosterone 37.5mg (Lot #04012019TN “and Testosterone 100mg (Lot
#04222019TN? YF our quality unit failed to conduct an investigation for this complaint. In addition, your
2019 Micro ID log report, provided by your firm’s Vice President of Quality Assurance, documents your

In addition, your firm’s Vice President of Quality Assurance stated dissolution testing has not been
performed as part of a complaint follow-up ensuring, for example, but not limited to:

1. The pellet does not dissolve immediately (dose dumping);

2. The pellet remains integral:

3. Aminimum amount of API is released by the pellet over a specified unit of time; and
4. The pellet releases API at a rate that is reproducible.

Please note failures addressed in OBSERVATION 1.C.

OBSERVATION 6

Individuals responsible for supervising the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of a drug
product lack the training to perform their assigned functions in such a manner as to assure the drug
product has the safety, identity, strength, quality and purity that it purports or is represented to possess.

Specifically, your SOP 9.300: Training Program, states GMP training shall be conducted for each
employee (b) (4) based on date of previous GMP training. However, there are no assurances the

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1

Physical and electronic control of material storage areas is not adequate. Specifically:

a) There is no separate storage area for different (Db) (4) products to prevent
mix-ups. Bottles of (B) (4) _ intended for the U.S. market, EU market, and material derived from
engineering runs are stored together in the same bin within freezer (D) (4) . This bin is also used
to store () (4) material that has been rejected by the Quality Unit but is being released to the client
for non-clinical use. Of note, there are differences between the U.S. and EU (b) (4) manufacturing
processes.

b) Bottles of different status materials are stored immediately adjacent to one another and primary bottle

labels for the (D) (4) are not adequately designed to prevent mix-ups. Master U.S.

label (#02-00263 v1), Master EU label (#02-00318 v1), and Master Engineering label (#02-00316 v1) are

the same dimensions (~2inch x 3inch), font, and colors (black text on white background). There is no
barcode present for direct electronic control. Bottles of both accepted and rejected material are designated
by a “RELEASED” label that has green background and black text with identical font.

Freezer unit (Db) (4) in room (b) (4). which is used to store the (BD) (4) and (b) (4)

(b) (4) is poorly maintained and organized. During inspection
of the freezer on December 3, 2020, it was noted that the bottom of the freezer was filled with bottles of
(b) (4) . many of which were overturned. The bin containing the (b) (4) was
stored directly on top of the bottles. There was substantial frost build-up on the © bottles at the
bottom of the unit and on the shelves.

OBSERVATION 2
REPEAT OBSERVATION

There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and the failure of a batch or any of
its components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

Specifically,

A. The firm’s contract testing laboratory reported an OOS result of MM ppb for TOC analysis
(specification: NMT (BN) for (ET collected on 06/24/2019 from the'
| § Site# a located in manufacturing area of Building! The firm failed to initiate an investigation
for this OOS result until approximately 1 year later on (# LAB-00046) and concluded in
the investigation report stating, “As per the investigation, a review of online TOC readings, for
06/23/2019, 06/24/2019 and 06/25/2019, revealed that the TOC readings were within limit. The root
cause does not seem to be related to the operation of SNAG system or method used for testing.
It is more likely that the sample was contaminated during collection / transportation. Based on the
acceptable results for other POU’s, it can be concluded from the investigation that it is an isolated
event and that the OOS TOC result was most likely due to sample contamination during collection /
transportation. There was no impact as no product was processed with QS from (AE
since the last passing TOC result.”

The Quality Unit failed to investigate the following:

Somerset, NJ 08873-1145 [ Brug Product Manufacturer

 

1. The Quality Unit failed to review the TOC print outs collected from the return loop.

The Quality Unit reviewed the (G)@MH entered TOC data by the operators into the *
-8@) log book”, book # 027 issued from 04/24/2019 to 09/17/2019 but never
compared the accuracy with the print outs. A review of TOC print outs, which are the raw data
of TOC readings, revealed that failed TOC results were disregarded, and incorrect data was
entered into the logbook. This discrepancy was identified at the time of inspection.

B. OOS-19-023 was initiated on 06/13/2019 to probe the OOS results obtained during cleaning
verification analysis associated with Orphenadrine Citrate ER Tablets, 100 mg USP, batch# $900734.

Tablet Press (Equipment ID# 0626), did not meet the established
ug/swab. The reinjection of the original vial and (G4) samples
confirmed the initial OOS and no assignable cause could be identified for the failure. During the
review of chromatograms from initial analysis a peak was observed at run time (~
that was not integrated in sample swabbed from . Also peak at ~
n@e@is sample was not integrated. No further investigation was performed to
identify the peaks. Multiple unknown peaks were also observed in samples swabbed from

and 4 The investigation is silent on the identity of the unknown peaks in
cleaning validation analysis. From 4 the firm conducted fi cleaning validation
studies and ff failed to meet acceptance criteria. Manufacturing investigation CFI-OOS-19-023 was
initiated along with CFI-OOS-19-060 to investigate CV failures for Orphenadrine citrate residue
results generated on (SQ respectively. The manufacturing investigation focused
on the cleaning method and attributed the failure to steps related to the cleaning of the (B)X@)ENNF for
the (JR Tablet Press and did not address to investigate the source of unknown peaks in the
chromatograms. The investigation concluded that Orphenadrine Citrate tablets is a (BE. based
product and is hard to clean from the (4) CAPA-00202 was initiated on 5/31/20 to update SOP
NL-PR-106 to provide an improved cleaning method for removing Orphenadrine Citrate from the BI
(b) (4). SOP NL-PR-106 was updated in June of 2020. The Hydrocodone bitartrate/APAP Tablets USP
(7.5/325mg-S900294, $900295 and $900471; 10/325mg — $900472) batches were manufactured

The (BRA of the original vial and (@)MBYI samples confirmed the initial OOS and no assignable
laboratory error could be identified for the failure. During the review of chromatograms from initial
analysis unknown peaks at and were observed in multiple samples.
Additionally, unknown peaks at and were observed in swab samples from (ora)

and Pan along with OOS results for Trimethobenzamide HCI residue. The residue
limits were at of the specification for swab sample from (OM swab).
The investigation concluded that the failure is due to improper cleaning of equipment. The
equipment was recleaned and again samples were swabbed for determination of Trimethobenzamide
HCI residue. Unknown peaks were again observed at a. O24 and (60 in chromatograms
from (SRG after recleaning. No further investigation was performed to identify the peaks.
The firm’s procedure SOP No. NL- QC-023. 14- Laboratory Investigations, Section 2.6.3 deficiently
states that investigation is only required when

A cross-functional investigation (CFI-OOS-19-028) was initiated to identify the root cause. Based on
investigation it was identified that the capsule weight checker would accumulate powder and should
be completely dismantled during each cleaning.

The equipment was utilized for the processing of Flucytosine Capsules, USP 250mg (Batch $900123)
and the weight checker parts were not dismantled for cleaning prior to the processing of
Trimethobenzamide HCI Capsules, USP 300mg, Batch $801333. The investigation was not extended
to evaluate the presence of Flucytosine contamination in Trimethobenzamide.

In addition, the analytical method used in determination of Trimethobenzamide HCI residue was not

D. On 3/17/2020, the firm received a complaint regarding the presence of a foreign particle embedded on
Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen Tablets 10mg/325mg, batch $901339. Based on the firm’s
investigation, CN-000073, the black particle was identified as (BY rubber containing a
filler. The root cause was identified as loose black particles shedding from a mount of the|
used during manufacturing process. Upon examination of the Equipment ID # 819, which was
utilized for manufacturing of the subject bulk batch $901086 on , the firm identified that the
mounts under the {J had an appearance of shedding particles. During handling of drums while
(b) (4) operation, the particles could fall into the blend, and move forward to compression,
encapsulation or packaging of finished product. This (J) was identified as a non-dedicated machine
utilized for multiple products. The firm neither expanded the investigation to {MM other batches of
Hydrocodone/Acetaminophen Tablets 10mg/325mg of the same campaign, nor other products
manufactured using this (JM@. It was noted that (EN i is also used in GaviLyte N manufacturing
and similar contaminants were observed during in-process inspection of packaging operation (DEV-
SO-859-19-0024 and DEV-SO-859-19-0025).

The firm received a complaint (DPC-SO-851-19-0007) on January 7, 2019 regarding the presence of
” dark grayish-blue specks in the product GaviLyte N (Lemon), batch $801021 (Expiry September
2021). Based on the investigation, the external laboratory identified the dark specks as red-brown
particles of metallic nature primarily found in tin corrosion products. The investigation concluded
that the foreign material was most likely introduced after the batch left from the facility. It was noted
that multiple (five) incidents were reported during in-process check during packaging of GaviLyte
products which were identified as metal contaminants. The firm could not identify a proper root cause

on 3 out of 5 incidents, The firm does not have in the packaging line utilized for
GaviLyte products. The firm manufactured about batches between 2019 to 2020.

continued testing of the samples (expired and R&D batches) for Hypothesis (4. The
investigation remains open as of 09/24/2020.

2. The site did not qualify this particular contract testing lab and did not have a quality agreement in
place at the start of inspection on 9/10/2020.

firm initiated an investigation, LAB-00046 only on 7/25/2019 due to the delay in receiving the
results from the Contract Testing Laboratory. Based on the firm’s investigation, the root cause
does not seem to be related to the operation of (5)MAYH Water System or method used for testing
and it was more likely that the sample was contaminated during collection / transportation. It was
noted that the on-line TOC readings were above specification on multiple days between 6/13/2019

utilizing a (BMH detector, the site concluded the spectra of the extraneous peak matches with
the spectra of Acetaminophen.

In LAB 00051, the site identified contaminated glassware as the potential root cause; however,
the investigation does not explain how a single contaminated pipette can produce extraneous
peaks with different peak areas in some samples but not others. The investigation did not
include a historical review of similar OOE investigations, such as OOE 19-016 pertaining to

and 6.9.3 above, but do not provide this high degree of assurance (6.9.4), additional executions may be
necessary, or the cleaning processes may need revising and re-execution of the validation study.
Additional executions must be conducted under pre-approved protocol.

The cleaning procedure utilized for non-dedicated manufacturing equipment are not established prior to
routine commercial supply. We noted that the firm’s current practice is to perform cleaning validation
COR and if the cleaning validation fails to meet the acceptance criteria the firm
rer emeet mere the equipment till a passing swab result is obtained. The firm further continues the cleaning
validation and in multiple instances it was noted that the firm did not have (NT cleaning
validation studies and thus failing to meet Section 6.9.5 of the procedure. After the completion of |
cleaning validation, the firm performs only (b) (4) inspection for the release of cleaned equipment during
routine manufacturing operations. Therefore, with no successful minimum (QI cleaning
validations, the cleaning verification/ validation study gives no assurance that the cleaning procedure

investigation was initiated on 10/16/2017 for batch # S700837. The investigation, DEV-17-216
could not assign a definite root cause and extended to manufacturing investigation (CFI-DEV-17-
216). Since the (b) (4) line was dedicated to this product during that time, the firm did not
conduct manufacturing investigation until 1/8/2020. It was noted that the firm retrospectively
initiated manufacturing investigation, CFI-DEV-17-216 on 1/8/2020 and concluded that since
(OM filler #0894 was dedicated for (GRAMM) of Hydrocodone Bitartrate and
Acetaminophen Tablets USP, 10mg/325mg at the time of the OOS result, there is no quality impact
on any product or lots. The firm failed to meet the ()(@)N cleaning validation requirements.
No other cleaning validation was performed for this product until 8/15/2018. The firm converted
the (b) (4) line as non-dedicated from (as per the equipment log 0894) without
collecting swab samples prior to the release of the line for other products to ensure that
the equipment is free of Acetaminophen residue prior to introducing Temazepam Capsules.

Hydrochloride Tablets and Methylphenidate Chewable Tablets, for the calculation utilized for
‘total shared surface area’ for MAC limit calculation. The impact of this omission is not clear on
the MAC values where Methylphenidate Chewable Tablets is considered as the worst-case
product.

. As per SOP # NL-VA-002.8, entitled as “CLEANING VALIDATION AND VERIFICATION
STRATEGY” approved on July 25, 2011, revalidation is required when a change has been made
to the product, process, procedures for cleaning or equipment. Based on NL-VA-002.9, dated
February 03, 2016, changes must be evaluated for their impact on cleaning processes and evaluated
for the need to re-validate. The firm introduced Methylphenidate Chewable Tablets in 2015 to the
facility. However, an evaluation on MAC limits was never performed prior to the introduction of
this product. In May 2020, the firm realized that Methylphenidate Chewable Tablets should be
considered as the “worst case product” from a cleanability perspective. The firm updated the MAC
limits based on Methylphenidate Chewable Tablets on May 27, 2020. A risk assessment for cross
contamination due to the changed specifications was not performed until 10/27/2020. The

OBSERVATION 7

There are no written procedures for production and process controls designed to assure that the drug
products have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess.

Specifically, the firm transferred the product Temazepam Capsules, 15mg and 30mg (batch size (SF
Capsules) from building (5) in November 2018. The site manufactured{&MM@ batch as part of site
transfer evaluation and concluded that the process could be transferable. Based on the data available at
that time, the firm started manufacture of batches in 2019 and 2020. During this period, multiple batches
failed analytical testing and were subsequently rejected due to OOS’s in ( and
GR results. One batch was reported as Out of Expectations (OOE) on Assay results. The firm
— the OOS/OOE batches without identifying the root cause and released the batches those met
specifications without evaluating the batches with additional samples testing as of 9/30/2020. The firm

OBSERVATION 9

Separate or defined areas to prevent contamination or mix-ups are deficient regarding the manufacturing
and processing operations.

Specifically, controls in place are deficient to prevent contamination of potent drugs into manufacturing
and processing areas where other drugs are manufactured.

The firm routinely manufactures about {M§ commercial drug products (including two potent drugs i.e.
Methylergonovine Maleate Tablets, 0.2 mg and Misoprostol Tablets, 0.1 mg and 0.2 mg) in Buildings
and (9 Raw materials, in-process products, and production equipment are frequently moved
from one SMa to the other during , and
(OME. Manufacturing areas, production equipment, and utilities used to manufacture potent drugs are
shared with the non-potent drugs. The site does not perform any testing to determine the traces of these
potent compounds in the manufacturing areas. Currently there is no data available to ensure that the areas
where non-potent drugs are manufactured, processed and packaged are free from potent compounds.

Additionally, the firm uses || company-owned trucks to move materials and in-process products from

one building to the other. The site does not have any controls in place to clean/sanitize these trucks when
used to move potent materials and in-process drugs.

OBSERVATION 10

Appropriate controls are not exercised over computers or related systems to assure that changes in master
production and control records or other records are instituted only by authorized personnel.

Specifically,

A. Firmware instruments (those without a computer attached and not connected to a network) in the
QC laboratories do not have sufficient controls to prevent unauthorized access to, change to, or
omission of data results. For example, the Density Meter #1295 and Viscometer (DV2T) ID#03 |
do not have unique logins for BI analysts and the Density Meter #1295 electronic raw data |
results can be deleted from the instrument. The Density Meter is used to test Finish Products such |
as: Methylphenidate Hydrochloride Oral Solution, Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution,
Potassium Chloride Oral Solution USP, GaviLyte-C/G, and GaviLyte-N. Viscometer is used to
test Finish Products such as: Potassium Chloride Oral Solution and Voriconazole for Oral

Suspension.
B. Shared user [Ds and passwords were found being used by employees for Equipment.
On 9/24/2020, during the inspectional walkthrough of building we observed a

manufacturing operator (8) using another employee’s user ID and password while logging into
the (BRB Equipment (Equipment # (8G). The manufacturing operator stated that the ‘user

OBSERVATION 7

Supplies outside of the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood were not disinfected prior to entering the
aseptic processing areas.

Specifically,

On 10/14/2020 we observed a bottle of sterile III fall onto the floor of the
Cleanroom during aseptic processing of IV bags in the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood. The nozzle came into

contact with the ISO 7 Cleanroom floor. Your employee proceeded to pick up the bottle from the ground
and use this spray bottle in the ISO 5 area without sanitizing the nozzle.

You produced sterile drug products using non-sterile (b) (4) in the ISO 5 Cleanroom
Hood. These products include but are not limited to: LL-37 2000MCG/ML, Thymosin Beta

Cypionate w/ Olive Oil 200MG/ML 10ML. In addition, you produced Myer’s Basic IV bags through
admixing with sterile ingredients made onsite from bulk to sterile in the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood. This
includes for example, Myer’s Basic IV bag contains stock solution Ascorbic Acid, Glutathione, B
Complex, Potassium Phosphate, B-12, and Sodium Bicarbonate which were made onsite through
non-sterile (EAI) by your sterile technician.

OBSERVATION 8

Systems for monitoring processing and environmental conditions in aseptic processing
areas were deficient.
Specifically,

A) Your employees who produced sterile drug products have never performed media fills.
For example:

e Your sterile technician who has been producing sterile drug products (from non-sterile to
sterile and sterile-to-sterile) for over three years has never performed a media fill during
this time.

° Youll phlebotomists and Naturopathic Doctor produce IV bags in the IV room, for
shipping to out-of-state patients. They have never performed a media fill.

e Your Dispensary staff MG) and Pharmacist fill sterile drug products in the Dispensary
room. They have never performed a media fill.

B) Environmental monitoring in the aseptic processing area has not been performed since October
2018. The last time your vendor performed active air sampling in the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood and
ISO 5 IV hood was on 10/26/2018. Fungal contamination (1 CFU) was detected in the ISO 5
Cleanroom hood during this sampling. Since then, you have not implemented a program to
routinely monitor environmental conditions in the aseptic processing area.

C) Personnel monitoring has never been conducted even though) stoppering is
performed by your sterile technician when producing sterile drug products from non-sterile to
sterile using aseptic (b) (4) For example, on 10/16/2020, we observed your sterile technician
stoppered eight vials containing Selank 1000 MCG/ML 5 ML vials, LOT 1016202002
EXP 11/16/2020 in the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood after aseptic

157 2000 MCG/ML, and Testosterone Cypionate w/ Olive Oil 200MG/ML 10ML. You produced IV bags
from stock solutions which you make through non-sterile (b) (4) these products include but
are not limited to IV bag with (b) (4) and Myer’s Basic IV bag with Taurine. You filled sterile
drug products in syringes, these include Testosterone Cypionate w/ Olive Oil and Nandrolone w/ Olive
Oil.

OBSERVATION 9

Your firm exposed stock solutions, used in the production of drug products intended to be
sterile, to worse than ISO 5 quality air.

Specifically,

Stock solutions were stored in an unclassified area for further use after the container closure
system had been punctured multiple times, and therefore compromised, throughout the assigned
expiry period. For example,

Your sterile compounding log shows that on 09/28/2020, a batch of Testosterone Cypionate w/ Olive Oil
stock solution was produced wing DAs in the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood and was

assigned LOT (G)Q4)§ Exp 11/30/2020.

On 10/20/2020, we observed filling of syringes using of this stock solution LoT ya EXP
11/30/2020 stored in the unclassified Dispensary room. Prior to filling, we counted at least five (5)
existing puncture marks on the vial stopper. The product had been stored at room temperature in an
unclassified area for an undocumented period. During filling on 10/20/2020, we observed your
dispensary staff (b) (6) puncture this stock solution four times with a syringe needle in an unclassified
area and returning this stock solution to a cabinet in the unclassified dispensary room at room
temperature for future use. Per your employee, there are no assigned hold time limits for stock solutions
that are subject to multiple entries, they go by the expiry date on the stock solution vial.

These include but are not limited to Testosterone Cypionate w/ Olive Oil 10ML stock solutions
and Nandrolone w/ Olive Oil 10ML stock solutions produced at your facility using non-sterile [ll

OBSERVATION 10

The use of sporicidal agents in the aseptic processing area were inadequate.

Specifically,

your sterile technician did not sanitize the aseptic processing area with disinfectant after maintenance to
replace ceiling lights was performed in the ISO 7 Cleanroom on 10/17/2020. Your sterile technician
stated that during the morning cleaning on 10/19/2020 the ceiling in the ISO 7 Cleanroom was wiped
with sterile ete only and that disinfectant was not used until the end of the day, after several sterile drug
products were made on 10/19/2020.

The following sterile drug products were made on 10/19/2020 through non-sterile

in the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood: B12 for IV 2MG/ML, LOT 1019202001 EXP
12/03/2020; B Complex, LOT 1019202002 EXP 12/03/2020; Potassium Phosphate 3MMOL/ML,
LOT 1019202003 EXP 12/03/2020; and Hydrogen Peroxide 3%, LOT 1019202004 EXP
11/03/2020.

OBSERVATION 11

The final containers/closures used for drug product intended to be sterile were not

sterilized or (b) (4)
A) vials were not appropriately handled and stored to ensure sterility at time of use,
speciticall bags are reused for storing sterile vials after the vials are

example, your vials are purchased non-sterile and
. Your sterile technician stated they wrap vials wit efore placing it into
th and after completing a cycle it is taken into the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood

to be aseptically packed into non-sterile bags. According to your sterile technican, the
vials are wiped down with sterile and sterile wipes inside the ISO 5 hood

before storing in a bag. When asked if the bags are ever reused for storing
(b) (4) vials, your sterile technician stated yes.

     

 
 
  
 
  

In addition, unused vials were stored in a non-sterile (4) bag and reused in subsequent

batches without further sterilization. For example, after your sterile technician aseptically filled

Selank LOT 1016202002 on 10/16/2020, there were four unused opened vials left in the ISO 5

Cleanroom hood. We observed your sterile-technician place these four vials back into a

bag containing other HYG) vials. Your sterile technician stated that vials that have been
and have been brought into the ISO 7 Cleanroom is considered stored regardless

of however many times the vials are taken out of the (b) (4) bag.

 

You produced sterile drug products using non-sterile (b) (4) the ISO 5
Cleanroom Hood. These vials are used on following products but are not limited to: LL-
37 2000MCG/ML, Thymosin Beta 2000MCG/ML, Thymosin Alpha 2000MCG/ML,
GHRP 2000MCG/ML, Semax 1000MCG/ML, Selank 1O0OOMCG/ML, Ipamorelin
2000MCG/ML, BPC-157 2000MCG/ML, and Testosterone Cypionate w/ Olive Oil
200MG/ML 10ML.

B) Opened packages of tamper-evident sterile syringe caps are saved and reused in a
subsequent batch. Specifically, on 10/20/2020 we observed your dispensary staff (b) G)use
tamper-evident caps from an existing opened package stored in the unclassified Dispensary Area
to fill Testosterone Cypionate w/ Olive Oil LOT (Om EXP 11/30/2020 into from a stock
solution into four 1ML syringes.

For example:

e From 08/03/2020 to 09/25/2020, dispensary staff filled and dispensed approximateh
batches of Testosterone Cypionate w/ Olive Oil in the Dispensary Area from stock
solutions into syringes. The expiry dates for the stock solutions were assigned to these
repackaged drug products. Each batch contained (b) (4) syringes for a

supplies.
e From 08/03/2020 to 09/25/2020 dispensary staff filled and dispensed approximately I
batches of Nandrolone w/ Olive Oil in the Dispensary Area from stock solutions into

syringes. The expiry dates for the stock solutions were assigned to these filled dru
products. Each batch contained (b) (4) syringes for a
supplies.

OBSERVATION 12

Your employee produced a sterile drug product using expired material
Specifically,

On 10/16/2020, your Phlebotomist (©) (6) prepare and administer an IV bag containing Taurine, LOT
0827202007 in the ISO 5 IV hood. The Taurine stock solution used to make this lot had expired on
10/12/2020 (four days expired). Your patient records show that this product was administered to a
patient on 10/16/2020 at 9:30AM.

Your phlebotomists produced IV bags with additives (e.g., Taurine,

   
 

) in the ISO 5 IV hood. These IV bag additives are shipped overnight per

patient request.

OBSERVATION 13

The ISO-classified aseptic processing areas and surrounding areas had difficult to clean
and visibly dirty equipment or surfaces.

Specifically,

During aseptic processing on 10/14/2020 and 10/16/2020, we observed your sterile technician produce
Myer’s Basic IV Bag (from sterile-to-sterile) and Selank 1000MCG/ML 5 ML, LOT 1016202002 EXP
11/16/2020 (from non-sterile (b) (4) in the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood. We observed the
following:

A) Rust-colored discoloration and damage on all the HEPA filters in the ISO 7 Cleanroom and ISO 8
Anteroom.

B) Rust-colored discoloration on the ISO 5 Cleanroom HEPA filter.

C) ISO 5 Cleanroom workbench is composed of wood-like laminated materials and the top of the
workbench is peeling from the side that directly contacts the HEPA filter.

D) A heating vent is located directly underneath the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood and within the ISO 7
Cleanroom. On 10/22/2020, we observed filth build-ups underneath the vent screen and the vent was
blowing warm air into the Cleanroom. This air supply vent does not appear to have HEPA filtered
alr.

E) Your) fluid transfer pump with residues and chipped paint on its surface is routinely
stored inside the ISO 5 Cleanroom hood during aseptic processing. For example, we observed this
equipment in the ISO 5 area during aseptic processing of Myer’s Basic IV bag on 10/14/2020 and
Selank LOT 1016202002 on 10/16/2020. In addition, we observed this equipment’s cord hanging
outside the ISO 5 cleanroom hood during aseptic processing. The cord was touching the waste bin
and the Cleanroom floor.

OBSERVATION 15

Beta-lactam and hazardous drugs were produced without providing adequate
containment, segregation, and cleaning of work surfaces, utensils, and personnel to
prevent cross-contamination.

Specifically,

You produces hazardous drugs in the unclassified Dispensary Area without an adequate segregation and
cleaning of equipment and work surface to prevent cross-contamination. The following table includes a
list of non-sterile drug products that are produced and sterile drug products that are filled in the
unclassified Dispensary Area.

NON-STERILE DRUGS [STERILEDRUGS
[Betalactam [Ceftriaxone None

Hazardous drugs Anastrozole, Testosterone, Estradiol, Testosterone, Nandrolone
Progesterone, Finasteride, Fluconazole, Oxytocin
For example:

A) On 10/26/2020, we observed your non-sterile technician produce Anastrozole LOT 10-26-2020 B
outside of “(b) 4) hood, specifically, your technician was pouring this SG) ona
counter near the sink in the unclassified Dispensary room.

B) On 10/22/2020 and 10/26/2020 we observed built-up powder residues on the inside and outside of
the capsule counter machine. Per your non-sterile technician, all non-sterile capsule products
produced by your firm are counted with this machine. The capsule counter is supposed to be taken
apart for deep cleaning and cleaned with (b) (4) prescription
order. Your non-sterile technician stated that the capsule counter should have been cleaned

batch, but the dispensary staff (b) (6) was too busy with other patient
orders. Your non-sterile technician also stated that neither the deep cleaning nor the cleaning
is documented.

C) On 10/20/2020 we observed dried white residues on inside of the cleaned blender which is used for
mixing (#4) non-sterile products. This blender had been cleaned per your non-sterile technician and
the blender is cleaned (2m.

D) On 10/20/2020 we observed dried white residues on the metal capsule filling tray. We also observed
dents and scratches (too numerous to count) on this tray. Your non-sterile technician stated that there

are new filling trays in the Dispensary area but they are wait to open this new set of filling trays for
when the facility is up to (b)(4)

E) From 10/14/2020 to 10/20/2020 we observed (A) residues built-up behind your {M9 non-sterile

hoods, on the walls, and windows in the unclassified Dispensary area. According to your
non-sterile technician, these non-designated hoods are used for weighing and filling non-sterile drug
roducts. Your non-sterile hoods are cleaned and
batches with ). Your technician stated tha is only used inside
these hoods. You do not use any oxidizing or sporicidal agent to decontaminate the hoods
after handling these hazardous drug materials. You also do not have any procedures for handling and
cleaning hazardous drug products, and you do not document in any way your cleaning activities in
these hoods.

  
 
  

F) The dishwasher is used to simultaneously clean equipment used in sterile and non-sterile production,
this includes glass beakers and spatulas. Per your non-sterile technician, your firm has not validated
that the dishwasher cycle adequately removes residues of hazardous drugs with household detergent
(b)(4) and does not cause cross-contamination of equipment cleaned in

the same cycle.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1
Non-microbial contamination was observed in your production area.

Specifically, On 8/26/2020, I observed the tableting room had a fine blue dust/residue coating the walls, ceiling,
ceiling vent, blender lid, humidifier, air conditioner and a darker accumulation of the blue dust/residue on the
wheels of your stationary blender. This blue colored dust/residue, which is generated during the production of
tadalafil and sildenafil, was so pervasive that it had infiltrated into the other production areas of your facility.

On 09/01/2020, the room was reported to be clean, however the blue dust/residue was observed in the humidifier
and as a coating on other surfaces.

The blue dust/residue was observed within your Non-Hazardous and Hazardous Rooms. For example, I observed
a blue residue inside the unsealed transfer holes that lead to the Hazardous Room. The products compounded in
these rooms do not contain blue coloring.

On 09/03/2020, production of Tadalafil 6mg lot P51 was observed in the tableting area. At the same time, in the
Hazardous room a hazardous dermatological drug product (() (4) ) was being produced.

Your firm uses all rooms to produce drug products. The production log shows that on a given day your firm
produced approximately"" drug products. These include but are not limited to: tadalafil 6mg, tadalafil 9mg.
dexamethasone phonophoresis 0.3% gel, tramadol 25mg/ ketorolac 10mg troches, and omeprazole (flavored)
2mg/ml suspension.

OBSERVATION 2
Laboratory analysis of hormone sample determined the strength was below the declared label claim.

Specifically, On 09/01/2020, I observed () (4) _ had a
failing potency result. The contract testing laboratory notified your firm on 07/14/2020 that the (B) (4) test
result was 89.6% (Spec: (b) (4) ). The failing result was confirmed by the contract testing laboratory. The
stock drug (Bb) (4) was used in the production of
approximately 9 other drug products.

On 09/03/2020, when asked if there was an investigation, the director of regulatory, quality and compliance
provided a corrective action document with the date of 07/08/2020 for the failing product. I noted that the date of
the corrective action was 6 days before the initial failure was notified (07/14/2020).

The pharmacist-in-charge verified and stated the corrective action had not been conducted for drug produced on
08/12/2020 using the failing (D) (4) stock.

(b) (4) has a beyond use date of 12/22/2020.

The record for (b) (4) does not have a weight for the
ingredient, (D) (4) There was no deviation or investigation into this error. According to the “OUT OF
SPECIFICATION INVESTIGATION” standard operating procedure section 8.4-8.5, all deviations must be
documented and all validation failures must have a formal investigation and action plan.

OBSERVATION 3
Buildings used in the processing of a drug product are not maintained in a good state of repair.

Specifically, I observed the wall in the Hazardous room and your compounding equipment cleaning area
in disrepair.

For example,

A) I observed that the wall between the tablet compounding room and the Hazardous room has unsealed
holes where blue residue/dust was observed. I observed the blue residue/dust on the perimeter of the
wall (i.e. ceiling, floor and sides).

B) Equipment found drying near a yellow painted wall. The wall was torn, scratched, discolored and had
dry wall exposed.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM I OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

You produced hazardous drugs without providing adequate segregation, cleaning of work surfaces and cleaning
of utensils to prevent cross-contamination.

Specifically,

(A) The capsule machine is not cleaned with a deactivating agent after each compounding preparation. On
9/21/2020, | observed the technician compounding DI-EST PROG TEST SR 2.5/50/0.5 MG CAPSULE (Lot #
09182020@38), ESTRADIOL DHEA SR 0.25/5 MG CAPSULE (Lot # 09212020@2), and DHEA MICRO SR
(() (4) (CLEAR/VEGGIE) 2.5 MG CAPSULE (Lot # 09212020@15). The capsule machine was vacuumed
to remove remnants of (b) (4) and only wiped cleaned with (b) (4) in between compounding
preparations.

(B) Deactivating agent is not used to clean the non-dedicated equipment used in the preparation of non-
hazardous and hazardous drug products.

OBSERVATION 2
You used a non-pharmaceutical grade component in the formulation of a drug product.

Specifically, (b) (4) water was used as an ingredient in non-sterile compounded drug products, such as
NALTREXONE 4 MG/ML LIQUID (Lot # 06032020@68) for Rx # (1) (6). Your firm did not conduct microbial
and/or chemical analysis to ensure the quality of (b) (4) water used in your compounded preparations is
pharmaceutical grade.

OBSERVATION 3

Your firm released drug product in which the strength differs from, or its purity or quality falls below, that which
it purports or is represented to possess.

Specifically, the following lots of compounded drug preparations were found to be out of specification after the
lots were dispensed. However, no recall of the dispensed prescriptions was initiated following the receipt of the

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Written records of investigations into unexplained discrepancies do not always include the conclusions
and follow-up.

For example:

a) An investigation (DEV 20-020, July 2020) concerning the leaking of finished and filled syringes in Ketamine
HCL 10 mg/ml, 5 ml ina 5 ml syringe lot(B) (4) _ discovered during visual inspection of filled drug product,
did not fully pursue root cause to determine adequacy of container and closure system integrity for marketed
sterile drug products and specifically why filled syringes were found leaking. Per the investigation, ""The most
probable root cause for product leaking beyond the plunger stoppers in syringes for lot (b) (4) is
materials [the syringe]."" ..."" [STAQ] Method and machinery are possible contributing factors...""

b) Visual inspection results of filled syringes were found to contain extraneous unidentified visible materials
(particles) during 100% visual inspection processes, but no investigation was opened to identify the foreign
materials, determine root cause as to how visible substances are found in a drug that is () (4) and
containerized/filled in a HEPA filtered (ISO 5) environment, and prevent recurrence. For example, the following
lots were found with some syringes containing foreign substances:

i) Ketamime HCL 10 mg/ml lot (b) (4) 5 ml fill in a 5 ml syringe found 7 syringes containing particles in
June 2020.

ii) Hydromorphone HCL 0.2 mg/ml lot (b) (4) 2 mil fill in a 3 ml syringe found 1 syringe containing a
particle in June 2020.

iii) Morphine Sulfate 1 mg/ml lot (b) (4) =‘ 2: m fill in a 3 ml syringe found 1 syringe containing a particle in
July 2020.

iv) Hydromorphone HCL 0.2 mg/ml lot (b) (4) 50 mi fill in a 50 ml syringe found 1 syringe containing a
particle in August 2020.

OBSERVATION 2
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
did not include adequate validation of the aseptic process.

For example:

a) The Smoke Study performed in Production Room D is not adequate to show production areas have
unidirectional airflow, as the Study shows detection of some instances where there is turbulence.

I) The Smoke Study in the ISO 5 hood in Room D shows that air (smoke) rises towards the ceiling in areas
adjacent to the ISO 5 Hood instead of cascading towards the floor where uptakes are located, indicating
turbulence instead of unidirectional airflow. Turbulence is also indicated in areas where ISO 5 air meets ISO 7 air.

ID) The ISO 7 area, where the ISO 5 hood is located, was not fully included in the Smoke Study to demonstrate air
flow adequacy and impact on the ISO 5 environment. The hood generates(D) (4) directed (ISO 5) air and is
open to the ISO 7 environment which produces vertically (downward) flowing air.

The Smoke Study video shows the following from the hood in Production Room D:
i) At 00:37-00:40 there is turbulence

ii) At 00:50-00:54 there is turbulence
iii) At 01:33-01:47 there is air rising upwards
iv) At 02:03-02:07 there is turbulence

b) Transfer of items from ISO 7 to ISO 5 are transferred directly, not fully in an aseptic manor. For example, the
formulation bag, syringes and caps are transferred directly without an aseptic step at the point of transfer from
ISO 7 to ISO 5S.

c) Your media fills were not performed under the most challenging or stressful conditions. For example:

-Media Fill (Process Simulation) does not include processing media (b) (4) (a process step
prior o(b) (4)

OBSERVATION 3
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

For example:

a) Media plates used for detecting microbes (in ISO 5 hood areas during filling) with active air sampling do not
contain neutralizing agents to ensure detection and growth of microbes in the presence of disinfecting agents
utilized in the filling room.

b) There is no environmental monitoring of aseptic setup in ISO 5 hood areas, i.,e., no viable (air and personnel)
and no particle monitoring.

OBSERVATION 4
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for cleaning and disinfecting the room and
equipment to produce aseptic conditions.

Specifically, classified area disinfecting procedures (SOP 201 Classified Area Cleaning) do not ensure contact
times are accomplished, there is no contact time established for (Db) (4) and there is nothing in
the procedure determining how much area can be wiped with a single mop surface or hand wipe surface. For
example, it was observed on 8/27/2020, as a regular practice, that the Operator used the same hand wipe surface
to disinfect multiple production surfaces within the same ISO area.

OBSERVATION 5
The labels of your outsourcing facility's drug products are deficient.

The templated labels received of your outsourcing facility’s drug products does not include information required
by section 503B(a)(10)(A) and 503B(a)(10)(B) . Specifically, the dosage form of the product, such as “Injection”
for the ITV formulations, was missing. Some examples include:

i Fentanyl Citrate 100 mcg/2ml
Zi: Fentanyl Citrate 250 mcg/Sml
Fentanyl Citrate 1000 mcg/20ml

There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and the failure of a batch or any of its
components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

Specifically,

Incidents that occur during GMP activities that may have impact on the quality of products are classified as either
“Observation” or “Deviation” in the (6)(4))) system (SOP# QAS-NC-0001). While an “Observation” does not
require investigation, a “Deviation” requires investigation to find the root cause and potential corrective actions are
taken. Below are instances where the firm failed to conduct a detailed investigation when serious GMP violations
occurred in the production area. Instead, the firm recorded these occurrences as an “Observation” and closed the
incident without documenting all the investigation details, the root causes surrounding the issue and implementing
CAPAs, In other instances, we observed that the firm’s “Deviation” investigations are deficient in finding root
causes that are supported by scientifically sound evidence.

For example,

A. TRA An “Observation” titled, * :;
Batch Discarded” in(6)\(4))) was opened on 5/27/2020 and closed on 5/28/2020. This Observation
documented very limited information and did not provide any investigative details. However, upon
further inquiry during this inspection, the firm’s Vice President, Manufacturing stated that the firm
conducted an investigation and identified potential data
However, no such details were provided in the closed (b) (4) document. He also stated that the

personnel involved in these GMP violations are no longer employed with the firm due to the firm’s
investigative findings and the severity of the issue. This (6)(4) 7) record was not elevated as a
“Deviation” despite the firm’s Deviation Management procedure, QAS-NC-0001, requiring
classification as “Deviation” when there is a departure from quality standards like “controls in place to
protect or assure product quality” and “GMP compliance requirements”. The firm’s rationale for not
opening a Deviation investigation is documented in this (BY) Observation report as “This was an
isolated occurrence”. However, we found similar incidents, where incorrect materials or material lots
were used by operators, second person verified and signed, and have been reported as an “Observation”
and closed without further investigation:

However, on 3/25/2019, after identifying the missing root cause investigation, the firm added a
hypothesis study with a rationale, *

 

 
 
  

. This study was based upon the hypothesis that the root cause was a laboratory error if a retest
of different sample gave a passing result. However, the investigation did not extend to find what caused
a potential sample contamination and the source of the extra peak and prevent future recurrence.
According to the firm’s written procedure, QCA-GN-0001, “Investigations of Out of Specification and
Atypical Test Results”, a minimum of (6)(@) I) retest is required if a root cause cannot be
identified.

C. TR# @@HMXC): This Deviation investigation was initiated after Out of Specification (OOS) results

were obtained for from the swab samples taken during the (6)(4)
Cleaning Monitoring o and on 11/01/2018. The root cause, identified in
this Deviation Record for the OOS results for (6)(@), that cleaning of the!) with IPA prior

to use, had no scientific justification. The tanks were cleaned using the validated cleaning cycle

Due to an ongoing trend of (®)(4) OOS samples, the firm previously conducted a study on 10/26/2018

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

The responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit are not in writing and fully
followed.

Specifically,
On 4/21/2020 the firm updated their Master Batch Record (MBR) to change the tubing used during the
manufacture of Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP to (b) (4) tubing formulation ia part

under change notice CN-20-02348 as a result of Investigation 685634 for particulate matter observed in

several lots of Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP. According to the investigation report 685634, “(b) (4)
tubing is being replaced tubing *_ Investigation 685634 also indicates that these
particulates were also forming . Product Code 160101 was approved per CN-20-02348 on

04/21/2020 and the change will be verified per Protocol PR-20-00697 (approved 04/22/2020)”. However, it
should be noted that the firm’s investigation showed that these particulates were still forming
and the firm continues to use (b) (4) tubing in their filling process the
Ketorolac continues to make contact with the (64) tubing. The Quality Unit reviewed and approved change
control CN-20-02348 and Protocol PR-20-00697 which did not include the replacement of the (b) (4) tubing

 
 
 

   

OBSERVATION 2
Written procedures are not established and followed for the cleaning and maintenance of equipment,
including utensils, used in the manufacture, processing, packing or holding of a drug product.

Specifically,

Your firm did not perform adequate cleaning validation on Tanks (b) (4) and (6)4) which are used in
the production of multiple drug products including Lidocaine and Dexmedetomidine HCL Injection.
Lidocaine was discovered as a contaminant in lots 7067815, 7069770, 7069771, 6121853 and 6122207
of Dexmedetomidine HCL when an OOT investigation identified an unknown impurity HPLC peak as
Lidocaine. The unknown impurity was found in 5 of the PM ots of Dexmedetomidine produced at this
site. For each affected lot of Dexmedetomidine HCL, Lidocaine was the previously manufactured
product in the tanks. All affected lots of Dexmedetomidine HCL Injections were released and
distributed.

OBSERVATION 3
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
are not established, written and followed.

Specifically,

A. Personnel Monitoring was not conducted after the aseptic connection for the was made. On
5/1/2020 while observing set-up operations for Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate for Injection, USP,
40m¢/vial, 3mL Lot# 7072219/6124199, I observed that a technician had performed the aseptic
connection for a assembly. Upon completing this connection, the employee sanitized
their gloves and continued with additional operations. This individual did not receive personnel
monitoring for glove contact plates in filling room nor did they leave the room to perform glove print
personnel monitoring.

B. On 5/1/2020 while observing set-up operations for Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate for Injection,
USP, 40mg/vial, 3mL Lot# 7072219/6124199, I observed that a technician was wiping down a

hose using inappropriate aseptic technique. Firm management identified this hose as a
hose to = ae ‘or (tS) testing. The technician attached the hose to the

in the ISO 5 area.

   
 

OBSERVATION 4

The batch production and control records are deficient in that they do not include documentation of the
accomplishment of each significant step in manufacturing, processing and packing.

Specifically,

Aseptic connections are not documented on the Batch Record. Setup for filling requires that the firm connect the

     

observed this process during set-up operations for Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate for Injection, USP,
40mg/vial, 3mL Lot# 7072219/6124199. Batch Record review of Methylprednisolone Sodium Succinate for
Injection, USP, 40mg/Vvial, 3mL Loti# 7072219/6124199 revealed that none of the aseptic connections performed
were documented on the batch record.

OBSERVATION 5
There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and the failure of a batch or any of
its components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

Specifically,

A. As of 5/13/2020 the firm has not initiated a retrospective review on the impact to additional product lines
as part of the Ketorolac investigation 685634 which investigated the precipitate found in multiple lots of
Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection, USP.

B. While reviewing FAR 20-1497 regarding an OOS for an impurity later identified as Lidocaine
contamination in Dexmedetomidine HCL, the firm failed to extend review to other products potentially
impacted by Lidocaine contamination in compounding tanks (b) (4) and (64). When asked if the firm
extended their review to other batches manufactured after Lidocaine the firm only provided a Carry Over
Calculations Spreadsheet, which included all products manufactured in the tanks to say that their cleaning
verifications were effective enough to limit the amount of cross-over in the finished products
manufactured in those tanks.

OBSERVATION 6
Time limits are not established when appropriate for the completion of each production phase to assure
the quality of the drug product.

Specifically,

Your firm does not routinely validate the hold time for(b) (4) — drug products prior to Cua
into the drug product. The manufactures numerous drug products such as
ethylprednisolone Sodium Succinate for Injection, USP, 40 mg/vial, 3 0 2219/6124199.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and the failure of a batch or any of
its components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

Specifically,

A. The firm failed to conduct and/or failed to conduct adequate investigations for the following
recalled sterile drug products:

1 Neostigmine Methyl Sulfate Img/ml 5CC lot# 05-2018-11@5 with BUD of 08/23/18. The
product was recalled on 05/29/2018 by the firm via Recall# RC-2018-003 after the firm
determined that approximately 726 units out of ©) @) units were mislabeled with the incorrect
lot number (05-2018-25@2) and BUD (09/06/2018). An investigation was not conducted.

2 (b) (4) (Bevacizumab) Intraocular Injection (Ophthalmic Solution) 25mg/ml 1CC lot#s: 01-
2019-22@4 with BUD 05/07/2019 ©) units), 01-2019-09@9 with BUD 04/23/2019 ©)
units), 12-2018-28@9 with BUD 04/11/2019 © units), 12-2018-13@6 with BUD
03/27/2019 © @) units), 11-2018-28@5 with BUD 03/12/2019 ™ units), 11-2018-28@6
with BUD 03/12/2019 © units), 11-2018-21@23 with BUD 03/05/2019 ®™ units), and
11-2018-08@5 with BUD 02/20/2019 © @ units). The products were recalled on 02/11/2019
via Recall# RC-2019-001 for higher than acceptable number of subvisible particles. An
investigation was not conducted by the firm.

3 Dibutyl Squaric Acid 2% lots# 12-2017-04@10 with BUD 02/02/2018 ®® units) and 12-
2017-27@7 with BUD 02/25/2018"" units). The firm opened OOS investigation I-2018-004
on 01/15/2018 for stability sample Dibutyl Squaric Acid 2% lot# 12-2017-04@10 having
sub-potent results of 0.05652, which was""% of the expected amount (©)() at 30-day time
point. The Dibutyl Squaric Acid specifications are (b) (4) %. An additional lot of Dibutyl
Squaric Acid lot#12-2017-27@7 was analyzed and was found to be M0, of expected
(b) (4)) at 23 days post compounding. The firm recalled the products on 01/22/2018 via
Recall# RC-2018-001 (lot# 12-2017-27@7) and Recall# RC-2018-002 (lot# 12-2017-
04@10). The investigation did not include an evaluation to rule out laboratory error and the
root cause was noted to be a formulation issue resulting in a change in the diluent from
(b) (4) . No change control was initiated for this formulation change. The OOS
investigation report was prepared on 04/04/2018; however, the report wasn’t approved by
QA until 10/26/2018 without any documentation to explain the delayed time frame.

B. The firm failed to conduct investigations into presumptive sterility positives for drug products
purported to be sterile. For example:
1. On 10/29/19, the firm found filaments during the day” @ ead of media (day? an mrad
passe results) used to conduct sterility testing of Cefuroxime PF 3mg/0.3ml (Formula Id
14) Lot 10-2019-15@6, BUD 11/28/2019). A deviation (DR-2019-182) was initiated as
the firm failed to follow procedure, S-QMR-021 Sterility Failure Investigation, during
subculturing (no growth occurred during subculturing); however, the firm’s sterility testing
method is not validated, and no sterility failure investigation was conducted. This batch of
© 1 ml syringes was released by the firm’s Quality Unit on 11/4/19 and distributed.

2. On 11/07/19, the firm found a contaminant (contaminant type was not documented) during
QA review of the day ead of media (day ond” had passing results) used to conduct

sterility testing of Phenylephrine HC] 0.1mg/ml (Formula Id (5) (4) Lot 10-2019-24@4, BUD
02/05/2020). The batch record notes the media was subcultured on 11/07/2019; however,
subculture results were not documented, and no sterility failure investigation was conducted.
This batch of ©) @) 10m1 syringes was released by the firm’s Quality Unit on 11/25/19 and
distributed.

3. On 06/20/19, the firm found contaminant (contaminant type was not documented but
described as “most likely a particle” by firm personnel) during the day ead (day *eand
had passing results) of a pump to bag Media Fill (Formula 1d) Lot 06-2019-06@1, BUD
07/08/2019). The Media Fill batch record notes the media was subcultured on 06/20/2019
and no growth occurred during subculturing; however, the firm’s sterility testing method is
not validated, and no sterility failure investigation was conducted. This batch of me (50ml
and 250ml) bags was reviewed and approved by the firm’s Quality Unit on 06/25/2019.

4. On 06/19/19, the firm found a contaminant (contaminant type was not documented) during
the day” read of media (day? an had passing results) used to conduct sterility testing of
Cefuroxime PF 3mg/0.3ml (Formula Id ©) @) Lot 06-2019-05@3, BUD 9/1/2019). The
batch record notes the media was subcultured on 06/19/2019 and no growth occurred during
subculturing; however, the firm’s sterility testing method is not validated, and no sterility
failure investigation was conducted. This batch of ©) @) 1ml syringes was released by the
firm’s Quality Unit on 6/26/19 and distributed.

C. The firm failed to conduct investigations of customer complaints.

1. The firm updated their complaints procedure, S-QAC-018 - Handling Customer Complaints,
on 8/14/2019 and included training for the processing of customer complaints by sales team
members. The firm’s sales team received 9 customer complaints (October 2018 — March
2020) regarding leaking or broken container closure systems. None of the 9 complaints were

investigated despite 2 of them occurring after the sales team was trained on the customer
complaint procedure.

Inadequate investigations into quality related events were also noted during the 2018 FDA inspection.

OBSERVATION 2
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically, the firm’s environmental monitoring practices of classified and aseptic processing areas do not
ensure appropriate levels of environmental cleanliness. For example:

A. The firm failed to conduct investigations of environmental excursions to include microbial
species identification and perform corrective and preventive actions following identification of
objectionable microbes recovered from classified environments such as additional sporicidal
cleanings. For example, on 9/25/2019, the firm recovered airborne mold from two locations in
ISO-8 room 300 (the firm’s (B) (4) ) and airborne mold from 3 locations in ISO-7
room 302 (the firm’s (b) (4)

); however, the firm failed to initiate an EEI, only performed microbial
species identification for 2 of the 5 mold recoveries (Talaromyces wortmannii and Irpex lacteus,
both filamentous fungi), and failed to perform corrective actions such as additional sporicidal
cleanings.

B. Objectionable microorganisms such as mold and fungus are not identified to species level. For
example, from 9/1/18 to 3/11/20 a total of 294 environmental monitoring sample recoveries from
classified environments were phenotypically identified as mold or fungus and documented by the
firm’s staff; however, only 270 of these recoveries were microbially identified to species level.

C. Not all ISO-5 microbial recoveries are identified and investigated. The firm does not perform
microbial species identification on all recoveries found on operator’s sleeves unless the recovery
is CFUs. Operator’s sleeves were observed to routinely enter ISO-5 environments during the
inspection. From 4/1/19 to 12/31/19, the firm failed to conduct investigations including microbial
species identification on 73 microbial recoveries from operator’s sleeves and it is unknown if
these recoveries represent objectionable organisms such as spore formers.

D. The firm’s environmental monitoring practices of the il (b) (4)iaminar flow hoods” @ FH)
located in the firm’s ISO-7 Clean Room 202 are not supported by scientific justification for
sampling locations. For example, the stainless-steel decks of the LFHs ((b) (4) in dimension)
are perforated with approximately (b) (4) diameter holes except for an approximate (B) (4)-wide
non-perforated strip of stainless-steel surface located in the center of the deck. The firm was
observed to perform surface sampling of the perforated portion of the VLFH deck instead of the
uniform portion of the deck, therefore not allowing for complete contact of sample media to the
deck surface.

E. The firm lacks scientific rationale for environmental monitoring alert and action levels. For
example, the firm’s ISO-7 surface sampling alert level is ™@ CFUs and action level is” CFUs,
and the firm’s ISO-7 viable air alert level is ’CFUs and action level is” CFUs. In addition,
the firm does not perform EEIs to include microbial species identification (firm personnel
morphologically identify mold and or fungus) and corrective actions for ISO-7 microbial
recoveries unless the recovery is ()4) CFUs for surface sampling o1!®) @) CFUs for viable air
sampling. It is unknown if these recoveries represent objectionable organisms.

F. The firm’s personnel monitoring practices are — For example, on 3/6/20, two
technicians were observed to spray their hands witht )) (4) approximately 90 seconds prior
to performing gloved fingertip monitoring, and on 3/11/20 a technician was observed spraying

their hands with immediately before fingertip personnel monitoring.

G. The firm’s environmental monitoring personnel procedures and sampling methods are
inadequate and do not ensure recovery of microbes. For example, firm procedure, S-QMR-008 —
Personnel Monitoring, states “() (4) . — -

On 3/6/2020 during a pump to syringe media fill a technician was observed to quickly
and lightly tap their fingertips on the agar surface while performing gloved fingertip monitoring
instead of (b) (4) with adequate pressure to
ensure recovery of potential microbes.

Environmental monitoring deficiencies were also noted during the 2014 and 2018 FDA inspections.

OBSERVATION 3
Test procedures relative to appropriate laboratory testing for sterility are not written and followed.

Specifically, the firm does not conduct sterility testing of drug products purported to be sterile according to a
validated test method. For example, per firm management and as referenced in procedure, S-QMR-005 — Sterility
Testing, the firm conducts sterility testing of drug products according to USP <71> Sterility Tests. USP <71>
states “If the material being tested renders the medium turbid so that the presence or absence of microbial growth
cannot be readily determined by visual examination, 14 days after the beginning of incubation, transfer portions
(each not less than 1mL) of the medium to fresh vessels of the same medium (TSB and FTM), and then incubate
the original and transfer vessels for not less than 4 days”: however, per firm procedure, S-QMR-021 - Sterility
Failure Investigation, sterility tests which are observed with contamination particles during review of sterility
testing media at days (1) (4) are subcultured onto (6) (4) plates and incubated for (6) (4), and (6) (4) plates
and incubated for (6) (4), and if no growth is observed. the sterility test is considered passing. with no further
investigation required. The firm does not have validation data to support this alternative method, specifically to
ensure coverage of all anaerobic microbes, such as Clostridium sporogenes.

OBSERVATION 4

The written stability testing program is not followed.
Specifically,

The firm failed to conduct appearance testing as part of their stability program following the T=0
timepoint for any of their products. For example, the stability studies for the following products failed to
include appearance testing after the initial timepoint (T=44 days, T=74 days, T=104 days, and T=134
days): Buffered Lidocaine 1% in 10cc syringe, Buffered Lidocaine HCL/Epinephrine 1% and
Succinylcholine Chloride 20mg/mL in 10cc syringe. In addition, the firm utilized multiple lots within
their stability studies for testing of potency, sterility, endotoxins, and container closure; however, the
firm conducted the tests on different lots rather than conducting all the tests on the same lots.
Furthermore, the firm missed several timepoints within their stability studies and failed to institute a
deviation or CAPA to address the issue. For example, the firm has no potency test results for
Succinylcholine Chloride lot# 06-2018-07@4 for stability timepoints T=44 and T=134.

Stability program deficiencies were also noted during the 2018 FDA inspection.

OBSERVATION 5
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for cleaning and disinfecting the room and
equipment to produce aseptic conditions.

Specifically,
A. Dwell times for disinfecting agents are not met. For example: The firm uses (b) (4) and
(b) (4)  ((b) (4) ) for daily cleaning of ISO-5 “LFHs and ISO-7 and

ISO-8 environments. Per firm procedure, S-CMP-003 — Cleaning Classified Areas, and firm |
management, these disinfecting agents are used according to Technical Data Files from () (4)

(b) (4) & stating surfaces must remain wet for (b) (4)  0n 3/6/20, (b) (4) was
observed to be used on “LFH 1C and appeared dry (b) (4) after application. Re-application
was not observed. The firm has not conducted disinfectant efficacy testing to determine the

efficacy of a(D) (4) dwell time for(b) (4) —_ or (b) (4)

B. Disinfection of the plexiglas located at the top of each ISO-5. LFH and used to separate ISO-5
air from ISO-7 air, is not performed daily. The firm’s Clean Room Manager stated the plexiglass
which comes into contact with the ISO-S air is only disinfected during their (b) (4) cleanings.

Deficiencies regarding cleaning practices were also noted during the 2018 FDA inspection.

OBSERVATION 6
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
are not established and followed.

Specifically,

A. The firm failed to follow standard operating procedure (SOP), S-CMP-012, Aseptic Technique,
which states ""cleanroom technicians must move slowly, deliberately and avoid excess or
unnecessary movements while working within classified areas"". For example, on 3/4/20 through
3/6/20, firm personnel were observed to qove rapidly within the ISO-7 Clean Room 202,
immediately adjacent to the open ISO-5_ LFHs during sterile compounding. In addition, (SOP),
S-CMP-012, Aseptic Technique, fails to address personnel controls to prevent unnecessary
activities that could increase the potential for introducing contaminants into ISO-5 environments.
For example, on 3/9/20, firm personnel operating within ISO- | LFHs were observed to place
their forearms and elbows on the deck of the ISO-5|_ LFHs.

B. The firm’s production & operations staff failed to follow procedure, P#.2.1.1 — Deproygenating
Reusable Devices and Glassware, to store depyrogenated, aluminum sealed glassware and
reusable devices in an ISO class 8, or better, environment. During the current inspection,
aluminum sealed glassware to include 20L beakers used during sterile drug production was
found stored on a cart in a non-classified environment.

C. The firm has not performed an assessment to determine if non-sterile hand sanitizer is adequate
to be used during sterile gowning. For example, the firm utilizes non-sterile (b) (4)
(b) (4) ) on non-sterile gloved hands
during the gowning process to enter the ISO-7 Clean Room 202 prior to the final step of putting
on sterile gloves. During the inspection, employees were observed touching their sterile garments
after utilizing the non-sterile hand sanitizer.

Deficiencies regarding prevention of microbiological contamination of drug products were also
noted during the 2014 and 2018 FDA inspections

OBSERVATION 7
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding systems for maintaining any equipment used to control
the aseptic conditions.

Specifically, the firm’s smoke studies are inadequate. The smoke studies were conducted by vendor (©) (4) under
mock dynamic conditions on 11/04/2019: however, the smoke study videos only include fixed operations within
the ISO-5__LFHs and ISO-5 BSCs and do not include a full assessment of ISO-7 and ISO-S air interaction such
as the transfer of starting components and materials into the ISO-5 areas, common interventions performed by
technicians, or retrieval of product from the ISO-5 areas to demonstrate unidirectional airflow and sweeping
action over and away from sterile product under dynamic conditions. Firm management stated the firm had not
reviewed the November smoke studies or compiled a final report.

Further, the firm has not performed smoke studies of floor vents located in ISO-7 Clean Room 202, which are
partially obstructed by equipment, to demonstrate unidirectional airflow and ensure aseptic operations are not
compromised. Additionally. the firm has not conducted smoke studies near the laptop computer located in ISO-7
Clean Room 202 tagysure aseptic operations are not compromised. Clean Room 202 houses"" ISO-5(D)
laminar flow hood _LFHs) used to produce sterile drug products.

Deficiencies regarding smoke studies were also noted during the 2017 and 2018 FDA inspections.

OBSERVATION 8
Buildings used in the manufacturing, processing, packing and holding of a drug product are not
maintained in a good state of repair.

Specifically, the firm’s facility and equipment are not of adequate design or in an adequate state of repair. The
following concerns were noted during the current inspection:

A. The doors to the firm’s non-hazardous sterility suite (rooms 200-202) and hazardous sterility
suite (rooms 300-302) do not adequately seal to the floor. A gap under the door was noticed
during the facility walkthrough.

B. The metal tracking used to secure ceiling tiles in the firm’s ISO-7 Clean Room 202, which
houses LFHs used to produce sterile drug products, was observed with chipped paint in two
locations.

C. Water-stained ceiling tiles were observed within the firm’s refrigeration room, receiving and
materials inspection room, shipping room, and main production room where materials are
staged.

OBSERVATION 9
Routine calibration and checking of automatic, mechanical and electronic equipment is not performed
according to a written program designed to assure proper performance.

Specifically, the firm has not adequately qualified all equipment as capable of performing its intended functions
or operations before first use and your firm does not perform routine maintenance for all equipment. For example:

A. Your firm has not adequately qualified all critical equipment used to produce, test, and store sterile drug
products to include: (B) (4) . temperature control chambers (incubators). and
refrigerators. For example, the firm’s initial qualification of refrigerator Model (b) (4) (ID# NS-FRIG-
022) was inadequate. The firm failed to conduct an installation qualification (IQ) or operational
qualification (OQ) (i.e. empty chamber mapping). The firm’s performance qualification (PQ) only
consisted of an(b) (4) chamber mapping. The PQ failed to include open door and recovery testing,
power-loss simulation or alarms testing. The aforementioned refrigeration unit is located within the QC
Laboratory and is utilized for the storage of samples awaiting QC analysis and for the storage of stability
samples.

B. The firm uses a(b) (4) water system to generate water which is subsequently
(b) (4) into plastic buckets and used for dilution of disinfecting agents used in ISO-7 and ISO-8
classified spaces; however, there is no assurance the water used for the dilution of disinfecting agents and
used for cleaning of ceilings, walls, and floors is appropriate for use. For example: the fe (4)
(b) (4) water system has not been qualified and the firm does not perform(b) (4 of (b) (4)
(6) (4)used on the water system. In addition, on 3/6/20, the(b) (4) (Lot

(b) (4)) used every (b) (4) for sanitizing and disinfecting the system were observed expired
(expiry date of 11/05/2018), and the (Bb) (4) _ located on the water hold tank was observed as
expired. Further, plastic buckets used to transpor (fb) (4) water to classified spaces are(b) (4) with non-

sterile™™ and filled in a non-classified environment.

OBSERVATION 10
Appropriate controls are not exercised over computers or related systems to assure that changes in
master production and control records or other records are instituted only by authorized personnel.

Specifically,

A. Appropriate controls are not exercised over computers or related systems to assure that changes
are instituted only by authorized personnel. For example, on 3/9/20, the admin login and
password for the firm’s (b) (4) software were observed on a sticky note immediately
adjacent to the (b) (4) computer system. This software is used to perform endotoxin release
testing of drug products purported to be sterile.

B. Numerous examples of a lack of GMP document control were observed during the
inspection. For example, all firm personnel have access to a central data folder containing
numerous GMP documents and forms. In addition, blank forms such as QC Chemistry loose
sheets and OJT training forms, and OC Microbiology forms such as sterility testing and
(b) (4) _ ____ were observed uncontrolled and throughout the firm.

C. Complete record of all GMP data is not maintained. For example, partial GMP documents to
include QC Chemistry loose sheets and OJT training forms were found located in the firm’s
shred bin. Further, a Sterility Testing of Sterile Batches and Preparations from (Form Code F-
QMR-005.A), was found completed, reviewed and signed off by Quality, in the firm’s shred bin.
A different original F-QMR-005.A form was noted in the sterile drug product’s batch record.
The firm’s procedure, S-GEN-005 — Good Documentation Practices (GDP) Procedure, prohibits
this practice.

Deficiencies regarding controls over computers or related systems were also noted during the 2018
inspection.

OBSERVATION 11
Incoming components are not stored under quarantine until they have been tested or examined, as
appropriate, and released.

Specifically, the firm’s logistics staff failed to follow procedure, S-IRS-002 Receipt of Controlled Materials, to
provide separate areas for “Quarantine”, Released”, and “Rejected” materials. Numerous quarantined and released
materials were observed together.

OBSERVATION 12
Time limits are not established when appropriate for the completion of each production phase to assure
the quality of the drug product.

Specifically, the firm failed to assess the impact on the quality of their refrigerated products when the products are
exposed to ambient temperatures. For example, the validation batches for their sterile drug product Cefuroxime
PF 10mg/mL in 1 CC syringes, formula ID (©) (4) does not establish time limits for the product to be out of
refrigeration (2-8°C). According to the Quality Unit, they have an internal policy that all refrigerated product
cannot be exposed to ambient temperatures for more than (D) (4) however this is not specifically recorded in
the batch record and there’s no data to support the firm’s (®) (4) policy. During the inspection refrigerated product
was observed being exposed to ambient temperatures during the initial counting of the products after
compounding, visual inspection, and final product labeling.

OBSERVATION 13

Your outsourcing facility has not submitted an adverse event report to FDA in accordance with the content and
format requirements established through guidance or regulation under 21 CFR 310.305 as required by section
503B(b)(5).

Specifically, on 10/09/2019, the firm received a customer complaint with an associated adverse event (CC-2019-
013) from the (Bb) (4) located in (DB) (4) , regarding 3 patients who
developed Toxic Anterior Segment Syndrome (TASS) after receiving Epinephrine 0.025%/Lidocaine 0.75%
(Formula Id® Lot 09-2019-04@2, BUD 10/25/2019). This report was investigated by the firm and determined
to represent a serious and unexpected adverse event: however, the adverse events were not submitted to the FDA
because the investigation concluded not to suggest a link between the adverse events and the firm’s product. The
complaint investigation was closed on 3/3/2020.

OBSERVATION 14

The labels of your outsourcing facility’s drug products are deficient.

Specifically, the labels of your outsourcing facility’s drug products do not include information required
by section 503B(a)(10)(A).

The direct product labeling is missing the following statements: “This is a compounded drug”; “Not for
Resale”, and, if the drug is dispensed or distributed other than pursuant to a prescription for an
individual identified patient, the statement “Office Use Only”.

The following list contains examples of labels for drug products which do not contain the

Pressure differentials are not monitored in areas where aseptic processing occurs.

  

specifically,

A) Pressure differentials between areas with different air classifications (ISO 6 cleanroom and ISO 7 anteroom)
ire not routinely monitored/documented prior or during sterile drug production. A review of the firm’s
-ompounding records noted that the firm does not routinely document pressure differentials.

3) Pressure differentials are measured with wall-mounted manometers which are not visible from within the
leanroom. For example, I observed the firm performing sterile compounding on 03/05/2020 and I observed that
he differential pressure gauge readings between the cleanroom and the anteroom were not within acceptable
anges. The cleanroom reading was .015 and the anteroom reading was .025. The firm was processing patient

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:
Building and Facilities

OBSERVATION 1
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically, your firm’s procedure, T06.04 (Bb) (4) — Environmental Monitoring System, Revision 02,
requires that operators document differential pressure, relative humidity, and temperature monitoring
before and during sterile drug production. Your procedure fails to require the recording and/or
documentation of these results as part of your firm batch record. The Sterile Temperature, Pressure, and
Humidity Monitoring Logs dated 2/4/2019 through 2/28/2020 demonstrated that your firm did not
always document the differential pressure, relative humidity, and temperature before and during drug
production in each ISO classified area. You failed to maintain adequate environmental controls during
sterile drug production.

Production and Process Control

OBSERVATION 2
Time limits are not established when appropriate for the completion of each production phase to assure
the quality of the drug product.

Specifically, your firm failed to establish validated hold-times for sterilized bulk drug products to
mitigate the risk of contamination of finished drug products. For example, the table below shows the
date production process steps were performed for selected batch records.

Quality

OBSERVATION 3

The responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit are not in writing and fully followed.

Specifically, your firm failed to adequately write and fully follow the following procedures applicable to your
firm's quality unit:

A. Your firm failed to adequately implement your firm's change control procedure, T01.05 Good

Documentation Practices, Revision 03 for changes made to approved protocols. For example:

1. During a review of your firm's performance qualification report, (DB) (4) Vial Washer, Model © @)

2. During a review of your firm's performance qualification report, (b) (4) (D) (4)performance
Qualification Report, Asset #(b) (4), Revision V.3 dated November 2019. Approved 11/12/2019, I
found your firm made changes to the protocol reporting section without a AW a change control
and receiving approval to revise the original approved protocol, (DB) (4) (D) (4)performance

Qualification Protocol, Asset #(®) (4), Revision V.3 dated November 2019, Approved 11/12/2019.

B. Your firm failed to adequately implement your firm's written, procedure T08.19 Investigation of Non-
conformance and CAPA Issuance procedure, Revision 03. For example, during a review of your firm's
performance qualification report, (b) (4) (b) (4) Performance Qualification Report, Asset # (6) (4),
Revision V.3 dated November 2019, Approved 11/12/2019, I found as a result of investigations into
documented deviations, your firm's quality unit made changes to the acceptance criteria documented
within the original protocol without obtaining your firm's management approval prior to its
implementation and ultimate approval of the performance qualification.

OBSERVATION 4

Your firm compound drugs that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs within the meaning of
sections 503B(a)(5) and 503B(d)(2). Specifically, a) you compound drug products that are identical or nearly

identical to an approved drug that is not on the drug shortage list in effect under section 506E at the time of
compounding, distribution, and dispensing: or b) are not identical or nearly identical to an approved drug, but
contain a bulk drug substance that is also a component of an approved drug, and for which there is no change that
produces for an individual patient a clinical difference, as determined by the prescribing practitioner, between the
compounded drug and the comparable approved drug.

Examples of compounded drug products that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs include:

A. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin
B. Menotropins Injection

C. Leuprolide Acetate Injection

Your firm produces sterile hazardous drug products (e.g. chemotherapy agents, etc.) and non-hazardous drug products
(e.g. fentanyl epidurals, etc.).

D. Disinfectant contact time (also known as ""dwell time"") and coverage of the item being disinfected were insufficient
to achieve adequate levels of disinfection. Your Associate Chief of Pharmacy provided documentation that your
firm uses (B)(4Y) disinfectant wipes during routine (4) cleanings as your bactericidal agent in your ISO-5, ISO-7,
and ISO-8 Classified Areas ((B)(4) 9) Mobile Unit and Ground Floor Inpatient Pharmacy) with a (6/4)
contact time.

However, the manufacturer's recommendations for this product states a contact time off Sninutes is recommended to
be effective when used as a bactericidal.

OBSERVATION 2
ou did not make adequate product evaluation and take remedial action where actionable microbial contamination was found

OBSERVATION 4
our facility design allowed the influx of poor-quality air into a higher classified area,

Specifically,

A. On 1/13/2020, we observed two (2) flexible hoses which are connected to your “(b) (4) Mobile Unit and lead to
a street water drain. The purpose of these hoses is to drain the (B)(4)§) from the sinks located in the (B/G)
Mobile Unit (Hazardous Area: ISO-7 Classified Anteroom: and the Non-Hazardous: ISO-8 Classified Anteroom).
The hoses are unprotected and exposed to the outside environment and appear to be cracked and discolored. Your
firm has not provided any supporting documentation to prevent the ingress of vermin or outside unfiltered, less clean
air.

B. On 01/22/2020, we observed your return air vents, located in your “(BY(4YI) Mobile Unit in the:

1. Hazardous Buffer Room (ISO-7 Classified} where chemotherapeutic agents are aseptically processed were
partially blocked by objects such as, but not limited to portable bins; stainless steel tables; and storage
shelving;

2. Non-Hazardous Buffer Room (SO-7 Classified) where non-hazardous sterile drug products are processed
were partially blocked by objects such as, but not limited to LAFH and a portable stainless-steel! table.

©. On 01/22/2020, we observed what appears to be a particle-generating (B)(4)) substances (black and off-white
substances), located next to the condenser fan, on top of the refrigerator, in your firm’ s Hazardous Buffer Room ocal
7 Classified) and Non-Hazardous Buffer Room (I1SO-7 Classified). These (6) (4) ~ substances are (b)

OBSERVATION 5
Personnel engaged in aseptic processing were observed with exposed face, neck, and ankles.

Specifically, on 01/13/2020 and 01/22/2020, we observed your pharmacy technician, who was engaged in aseptic
operations of Carboplatin 520 mg and Doxorubicin 105 mg, respectively, with exposed face, neck, and ankles in the
ISO-7 Classified Area of the “(b) (4) Mobile Unit Hazardous Compounding Area.

A. The smoke studies conducted under dynamic conditions did not generate smoke in all areas where aseptic operations
were performed to verify unidirectional airflow. for example, but are not limited to: the movement of materials into
the BSC (ISO-5 Classified); removing vials and syringes from outer packaging within the BSC (ISO-5 Classified);
cleaning of vials with{B)(4)9Yy. In addition, the smoke study did not capture your most challenging aseptic
operation.

B. The smoke studies performed at the door from the Hazardous Anteroom (ISO-7 Classified), which is under positive
pressure, into the Hazardous Buffer Room (1SO-7 Classified), which I under negative pressure, did not demonstrate
the Hazardous Buffer Room (SO-7 Classified) is maintained under negative pressure.

C. Nesmoke studies were performed to capture possible dust generating equipment, such as the refrigerator, located in
the Hazardous Buffer Room (ISO-7 Classified) and Non-Hazardous Buffer Room (I1SO-7 Classified). For example.
the top of your refrigerator contains a condenser fan, which is open to the controlled environment.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1
The responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit are not fully followed.

Specifically, the completed Daptomycin (b) (4))) Quality Assurance Review / Investigation (PR ID:
2200959, opened O7MAR2018, closed O6NOV 2018) related to a (b) (4)

) drug product contamination did not include adequate and complete impact and risk
assessments as required by SOP-95773 Manufacturing Investigation Reports.

OBSERVATION 2

Control procedures are not established which monitor the output and validate the performance of those
manufacturing processes that may be responsible for causing variability in the characteristics of in-
process material and the drug product.

Specifically, th (6) (4) System used to wash, rinse (b)(4) and sterilize components that are used in the
manufacturing of aseptically produced products (liquid, lyophilized vials, and carpujects) has not been
adequately qualified. There is no assurance that an adequate amount of (b) (4)

used to wash components (i.e.: stoppers, plungers and other (b)(4) ) has been dispensed
properly; there is a lack of assurance the proper amount of (b)(4) is dispensed properly as is not

monitored, and at various points during the cycle, the required temperature (i.e. ""C) is not maintained
and/or the temperature falls below the specification limit. The abovementioned parameters were
established during the qualification performed on October 25, 1996, Operational Qualification Procedure,
QP2840QP and has not been reassessed.

OBSERVATION 3
Adequate exhaust systems or other systems to control contaminants are lacking in areas where air
contamination occurs during production.

Specifically, the design of the (b) (4) from the General Processing Area (GPA) Dispensing
Room 401(Suite) Grade D is inadequate in that the air handling unit (6) (4) and (b) (4) supporting the
GPA dispensing rooms (6) (4) ) are maintained at the same pressure

differential which allows air to cascade from one room to the next before flowing out to the GPA
Controlled Not-Classified (CNC) corridor and the warehouse. All raw materials including APIs (potent
and non-potent compounds), and excipients are weighed in th (b) (4) before being
transferred to production. All products manufactured in GPA and SPA (Special Product Area) receive
materials that have been dispensed from(b) (4) . Furthermore, as part of the routine cleaning process,
(b) (4) ) and (b) (4) ) are used in between lots of dispensed
materials. Products manufactured in GPA include: Demerol HCl Injection, Retacrit Injection,
Vancomycin HCl for Injection and products manufactured in SPA include Hydromorphone HCL
Injection, Fentanyl Citrate Injection and Morphine Sulfate Injection.

OBSERVATION 4

Written production and process control procedures are not followed in the execution of production and
process control functions.

Specifically,

A. Investigation PR#2668142, opened 10Apr2019, was initiated for a failed glove integrity test performed at
the end of a campaign run (b) (4) for Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection USP Lot # 030653A
and 030553A. The investigation determined that a pin hole present in the shoulder portion of the glove
4) which caused the test to fail. Both product lots were approved and released for distribution as it was
deemed no product impact.

B. Investigation PR#4005864, opened 27Jun2019, was initiated for a failed (6)(@) barrier glove test performed
during routine preventative maintenance after the production o (6) (4)lots; Hydromorphone HCl Injection
(6) (4) Morphine Sulfate Injection (6)(@)), and Diazepam Injection (6)(4). There were als ™ lots of
experimental batches made. The investigation states that “the gloves were not replaced at the time of
discovery”. No product impact was determined and all associated batches were released.

C. Th (6)(@septic filling line media fill performed during May 29, 2019 is deficient in that the maximum
number of personnel described in the protocol was not met. During the inspection, the maximum number
of personnel was observed in the aseptic suite of the filling line fo ©/@)for the majority of the production
run of Retacrit (Product Code (6)\(4)"", Lot #12060DD. The media fill performed on May 29, 2019 for
aseptic filling line is not reflective of your firm’s current manufacturing processes used to manufacture
multiple products such as Vancomycin, Retacrit, and Hydromorphone HCl Injection that require a
significant amount of processing time during the aseptic fill.

OBSERVATION 5
There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and the failure of a batch or any of
its components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

THIS IS A REPEAT OBSERVATION FROM THE AUGUST 2018 INSPECTION.

Specifically,

A. The corrective actions initiated for mold recoveries in your aseptic Grade A and B zones, addressed on
the previous inspection, August 2018, FDA 483 Observation 1A, is inadequate, the firm does not have a
scientifically sound justification to have released Depacon Valproate Sodium Injection, 500 mg/mL, Lot
83170DD manufactured on 11/20/2017. The firm rejecte © lots of drug product with the exception of
this one lot due to it being (6) (4) sterilized. There was no written evaluation performed to prove that
product impact from mold contamination has been mitigated through (b) (4) | sterilization. The lot was
approved for release by Quality on July 5, 2018.

B. On 10/30/2018, an Field Alert McPfar # 2018-132 was initiated for particulate (needle/ metal scuff
marks) identified during th (6) (4) retain examination for Hyrdomorphone hydrochloride, Lot #

(b) (4) . On June 24, 2019, Biological Product Drug Report (BPDR)
MCP 2019-002 was initiated for particulate (needle/ metal scuff marks) identified o ""™Retacrit Lots#
(b) (4) The firm’s investigation failed to extend the

scope across multiple product lines, batches or similar products produced at this site to prevent
reoccurrence. These batches were released and approved by Quality.

C. On 11/06/2018, and NDA/ANDA Field Alert Report was initially submitted fo ""batches of Vancomycin
HCI Injection 10g 100mL, Batch 732303A, Expiry 01-01-2019 and Vancomycin HCI Injection 5g 100mL
Batch 830103A, Expiry, 08-2019 for (b) (4) observed with embedded material in
the glass during the (b) (4) reserve examination. Upon further investigation, 4 units from lot 830103A
were identified as having Critical B defects: 1 with a particulate on the internal neck of the unit in product
contact; | identified with having material in product contact, and 2 were identified as having embedded
material encapsulated in the glass and not in product contact. The product contact defects were identified
as (b) (4) residue and a (6) (4) powder like residue that was not identified. At the closure of the

investigation, Vancomycin HCl Injection Lot 830103A was approved for released by QA to the market on
December 17, 2018 as the firm deemed there was no product impact.

OBSERVATION 6
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
did not include adequate validation of the aseptic and sterilization process.

THIS IS A REPEAT OBSERVATION FROM THE AUGUST 2018 INSPECTION.

Specifically,

A. The airflow visualization study, Performance Qualification Final Repor Filling Line Smoke
Study PQR0221.10-17-01, is inadequate in that during of loading of the EPA Cart with vials
being transported for lyophilization on aseptic filling line ©) turbulence is observed between
the interface of the airflow pattern in the Grade A zone, Grade B zone and the operator’s removal
of the stainless steel tray cover over the partially stoppered vials. The doors on the HEPA cart
are opened into the Grade A zone from the Grade B zone and the interface of these two areas
creates turbulence as air moves across from left to right in the cart with the downward movement
of air in Grade A and the movement of air in the Grade B zone. The report was approved by
Quality on 09-29-17.

B. On December 16, 2019 while observing the manufacturing of Hydromorphone Injection Product
code (b) (4) , Lot # 12660LL on th (6) (4) Carpuject Line, operators we observed displaying
rapid hand gestures, and an operator was observed using their foot to kick a step stool in the
Grade A space. Additionally, on December 13, 2019, while observing the manufacturing of
Retacrit, Product Code (6) (4), Lot# 12085DD, on the M6 line, operators were observed leaning
over and talking over sterilized items being unwrapped within the aseptic core.

C. There is no assurance the carts observed in the Grade A area with wheels that are difficult to
clean are sufficiently cleaned to prevent the transfer of contamination from one area to the next.

D. Specifically, the sterilization qualification studies supporting the CPM (PQR0471.3MAX-18-
01), (b) (4) (PQR0471.3Max-17-02, POR0471.3MAX-18-01, PQR11699.MAX-19-01),
(6) (4) (PQRo284.11-19-01) and (6)(4) —(PQR0830.00-18-01) __ componentry
processing/preparation workflows do not demonstrate the sterilization o (D somponentry
(stoppers, plungers ®I caps) used in Hospira’s sterile injectable drug product container closures
(cartridges, liquid and lyophilized vials) according to current validation (component inoculum
challenge) processes (PR ID: 2439818 (6)\4)"")) and cGMPs.

E. We observed several poor aseptic practices within your Grade A zones i baa dan Pr srocessing fill lines

on or about 12/ 11/ 2019:

1. Operator were observed placing the wrapped filling manifold on th filling line,
cutting the wrapping with sterile scissors, and then removing the wrapping while it was
under the Grade A critical zone.

2. Lobserved no continuous particle monitoring while operators were making aseptic connections in
th (6) (4) cabinet Grade A zone during the production batch of Retarit Lot # 12085DD
(Product Cod (6)(4)!) on asepti © filling line.

3. Operators were observed performin (6b) (4) set up by working over opened product
(b) (4) prior to the actual production run. Additionally, the firm’s Quality on
the Production Floor was not able to see the critical operations occurring on the floor.

4. The produc (6) (4) was observed bein (6)'(4)

(b) (4) ). Furthermore, the (6) (4) was
observed being assembled using multiple attempts to (6)/(4) within
the aseptic core. This may compromise the integrity of th (b) (4) that lead to leaks
during the aseptic fill.

OBSERVATION 7
Written records of investigations into unexplained discrepancies do not always include the conclusions
and follow-up.

Specifically,

A. On August 21, 2019, an NDA Field- Alert Report McPfar# 2019-043 was initiated for the
recovery of 2 species of mold (Cladsporium species and Sarocladium terricola) equaling 62 cfu
from the multi-product aseptic filling lin ®)@ Grade A zone where lyophilized product is
transferred to the lyophilizer trayer. Furthermore, 6 cfu of bacterial colonies (Brachybacterium
rhamnosum) were recovered from the Grade A zone from the same settle plate. In addition, on
August 16, 2019, a recovery of 2 cfu of mold colonies (Aspergillus species) were isolated from
the personnel/material Grade B (b) (4) Grade A/B aseptic area.

The mold and bacteria recoveries were identified in the Grade A aseptic zone where lyophilized
and sterile solutions are produced. The firm has failed to identify product associated within the
filed NDA Field- Alert. However, according to PR#4138900, there wer (6) (4) lots manufactured
during the time of the event and (6) (4) lots were released into market. Excursions were
due to a missed cleaning and room pressure excursions.

B. On 12/02/2018, an NDA Field-Alert Report McPfar# 2019-150 was initiated for the recovery of
2 species of mold (Tritirachium oryae and Asperigillus sydowii) equaling 14 cfu from the multi-
product aseptic filling lin ()()Grade A zone where the aseptic solution connection is performed.
Investigation PR# 2514531 determined that there was no impact to Plazomicin Lot# 951003F
and released the batch. Root causes and corrective actions are not robust to mitigate risk and re-

occurrence.

C. On 08/06/2019, an ANDA Field-Alert Report McPfar #2019-037 was initiated for the recovery
of 1 cfu of mold growth found on a viable passive air site in the Grade A(6)(4) isolator on July
26, 2019. Investigation PR#4097952 rejected Glatiramer Acetate Injection 20 mg/mL, Lot
070653F. However, the investigation failed to implement an effective CAPA to control
contamination within the aseptic isolator barrier Grade A zone.

D. Investigation PR# 4146395 failed to adequately address the air reversal excursions affecting
Grade A/B (b) (4) (room 338A) from the Grade D area supporting the asepti ©) filling line.
The room air pressure increases when Grade D room doors are open at the same time as the
Grade B doors leading to the asepti ®) filling area. Corrective actions implemented did not
mitigate future occurrences

E. On 12/22/2018, Field Alert McPfar 2018-169 was initiated for 23 cfu of mold contamination
detected inside a HEPA car (b) (4), used to transport aseptic product from th © filling line.
The field alert did not indicate that Vancomycin Hydrochloride for Injection, Lot 96170DD was
implicated and later rejected as a batch disposition. Furthermore, the the Field Alert and CAPA
PR#2543245, failed to evaluate the (Db) (4)sanitation process of the HEPA carts from the dates
of closure, June 2019, to address the interim process that will be used to mitigate risk. HEPA
Carts are still being (b) (4) sanitized to be reintroduced back into the clean rooms.

F. On 01/23/2019, Field Alert Report McPfar 2019-006 was initiated in response to investigation
PR#4322158 initiated for lcfu for a Class 1, Grade A personnel that was working in the Grade A
zone o © filling line. The investigation identifies the cause of the mold species being due to
gowning. However, the firm has failed to implement appropriate corrective actions that prevent
mold excursions identified on Class 1 employee working inside a Grade A zone. All product
batches associated with this personnel excursion were released for distribution.

G. The firm has not initiated an overall effective corrective action plan to mitigate the re-occurrence
of bacterial and/or mold colonies isolated from points throughout the aseptic manufacturing
suites and supporting areas. Since the last inspection in August 2018, the firm continues to
recover bacterial and/or mold isolates from critical zones Grade A and B, supporting areas, and
Class 1 personnel.

OBSERVATION 8

Acceptance criteria for the sampling and testing conducted by the quality control unit is not adequate to
assure that batches of drug products meet each appropriate specification and appropriate statistical
quality control criteria as a condition for their approval and release.

Specifically, your overall endotoxin control strategy is inadequate and does not meet the requirements established
in SOP-9605 (6) (4) Monitoring Program and cGMPs.

A. There is no direct/formal confirmation of endotoxin sample hold time during the manufacture of the
Nivestim™ biologic drug product, including but not limited to bulk samples from lot 01320DD, during

compounding (BPR — Compounding (b) (4) ) and unit samples from vial filling (BPR —
Filling (b) (4) operations, ensuring conformance to time limitations established during the
(b) (4) validation (PQR0056.00-16-08).

B. The (b) (4) systems supporting the CPM (CARPUJECT™) componentry workflow fail to achieve

your targeted (b) (4) reduction of endotoxin. The performance qualifications report minimum endotoxin log
reductions o an © @olass cartridge, PQR0254.00-19-02 (b)(4)il PQR0254.00-19-02 (BY (4), 2.9
(plunger/rubber component, PQRO130.20-19-07) and 1.8 ™I cap, PQRO130.20-19-06). The routine

(b) (4) monitoring program for componentry (SOP-96954 Sampling of Manufacturing and Packaging
Components), in absence of (b) (A) eduction in endotoxin, does not employ a statistically valid/acceptable
sampling plan. For example (6) (4) glass cartridges (SOP-96954) will be assessed for endotoxin from""
(6) (4) batch which routinely exceeds (b) (4) units (6) (4) ?

(b) (4) ).

C. The Morphine Sulfate endotoxin specifications for componentry (SOP-96054), raw materials/excipient (6)(4)
) and drug substance (b) (4) do not ensure the finished
drug product will meet specification (b) (4) , If the drug substance, raw materials
and componentry approach the specification limits for endotoxin, the combined endotoxin load will exceed
the drug product specification. An endotoxin value in excess of the drug product specification may not be
detected through finished drug product testing due to the very limited/inadequate sampling plan (e.g () (4)

out of approximately (b) (4) units for drug product, Contro (b) (4) ;
(b) (4) )
D. The endotoxin control strategy does not include an evaluation (e.g. (b) (4) an (Db) (4) )

of the effect of hold time on the ability to detect endotoxin in all applicable sterile drug products (in-process /
bulk and finished). Further, you have not demonstrated your ability to detect endotoxin over your specified
sample storage time and conditions in complex formulations/matrices including but not limited to
solubilization and/or stabilization agents.

OBSERVATION 9
Master production and control records lack complete manufacturing and control instructions and
precautions to be followed.

Specifically, during the manufacture of Hydromorphone (lot 12660LL) in room 219A (Grade D) on
12/17/2019, I observed a (b) (4) repeatedly used for th () (4) transfer o (6)\4)

solution from (6) (4) . Th (6)(4)™ containing residual solution, is
kept uncovered and directly on the floor throughout the manufacturing process. The approved Master

Production Record (MPR (6) (4) ) and associated operating procedure (SOP-95285(17.0))
for th (6) (4) (CARPUJECT™ and iSecure™ Syringe Systems) production line, including but not limited
to the Batch Production Record (BPR) for the Hydromorphone (Product Code (b) (4)

(b) (4) .) sterile injectable drug product, do not provide procedures or training for use of
th (b) (4) for the (b)\(4) solution transfer and precautionary safeguards to adequately
protect from particulate contamination afte (b) (4) washing.

OBSERVATION 10

Your examination and testing of samples did not assure that the drug product and in-process material
conformed to specifications.

Specifically, you (b) (4)visual inspection processes are inadequate for the following:

A. On 1/14/2020, I observed the Heparin (Carpuject Syringe System) sterile drug product (product code (6)(4)
, lot 12565LL) bein (6)(4)) inspected (defect classification) after defect detection using the
(b) (4) inspection system in room 677 (6)(4)). I observed, during (b) (4) visual
inspection for defect classification (b) (4) and (b) (4) ) that failed to
undergo a complet (B) (4)visual inspection sequence ensuring the assessment of all possible defect
classifications and the correct criticality assignment, including the requirement to identify the most
critical defect according to SOP-96243 Carpuject Visual Inspection and Defect Library. This procedural
failure effects the development of visual inspection defect classification limits (SOP-96222 Defect Limit
and Monitoring Procedure) and tracking (SOP-95147 Defect Tracking), compromising statistical process

control.

B. On 1/14/2020, I observed liquid vials of the sterile Hydromorphone (controlled substance) drug product
(product code (6) (4))) lot 120653A) bein () (4) inspected for defect classification after initial defect
detection using th (b) (4) - an (b) (4
(b) (4) in room 615 (6) (4). The inspector’s defect criticality assignment trays are

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM ! OBSERVED:

 

OBSERVATION 1
A process whose results cannot be fully verified by subsequent inspection and test has not been
adequately validated according to established procedures.

Specifically, the following was noted from review of the Final Report for Performance Qualification for

| Packaging (b) (4), dated on or about 12/23/19:

A. The process control verification protocol (QP 19-416,-417 and -418, part 8.0) documents the
Vision System Challenge tests for incorrect/illegible carton part code and /or UDI barcode on the
carton label was a critical quality classification. The final report-(part 4.0) reads.as follows:

“*** Ail PQ tests of the *** Vision System with *** camera arid critical quality attribute checks
were performed, verified and demonstrated to meet all acceptance criteria***”.

i. However, the vision system atin as described in part 9 of the (b) (4)
packaging instructions (Document Number MBR-0602, revision 01), does not include
using a challenge carton with either an incorrect carton part code or incorrect UDI
barcode. The packaging project manager stated the optical character recognition (OCR)
capability of the vision system was never tested (challenged) to detect and reject incorrect
part codes or incorrect UDI bar codes during any of the (b) (4) performance
qualification (PQ) lots. .

ii. | He said the vision system was challenged: for missing / illegible codes, only. The
challenge devices for missing / illegible codes were not a controlled/standardized set of
test articles used for all performance qualification (PQ) lot tests. The test articles were

(b) (4) to each challenge S saul lot (b) (4) vision challenges were
performed per lot).

B. The final report (part 5.0) reads-as follows: “There were no exceptions initiated during the —
execution of the PQ protocols”. However Sane occurred and were not included in the

final PQ evaluation:
i. | Maintenance was required to adjust the vision system during (b) (4) production lot
number (b) (4). The engineering technician said he adjusted®

on the vision system because the-system was rejecting too many packages.
This maintenance activity was not documented or evaluated as a process exception in the
final report.

ii. | Vision system labeling rejects was a statéed critical quality attribute check for the
performance qualification, however the number of labeling rejects (nonconformances)
detected were not recorded or evaluated as process exceptions in the final report.

iii. | The packaging project manager stated rejected/mislabeled cartons were reworked during
(b) (4) of the production lots: However, the amount of rework was not recorded or
included the final report as a process exceptions.

OBSERVATION 2 .
Rework and reevaluation activities have not been documented in the device history record.

Specifically, the packaging project manager said mislabeled packages were rejected in (b) (4)
performance qualification production lots. He said the contents (b) (4)) were
removed from the rejected cartons and reused. The mislabeled packages were destroyed.

There was no documentation in the device isis —s for the (b) (4) performance qualification
lots of any rework or reevaluation of the rejected package components. Lot numbers for the performance
qualifications were (Bb) (4).

 

 

OBSERVATION 3
Procedures have not been adequately established to control. ah pea that does not conform to specified
requirements.

'| Specifically, the vision system is intended to detect and reject packages for lot numbers and bar codes
that are either missing or inaccurate. The packaging project manager stated the optical system detected
failures (rejects) of labeling non-conformances during production of (b) (4) of the performance

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Buildings used in the manufacture, processing, packing or holding of drug products are not maintained
in a clean and sanitary condition.

Specifically,
A.

On 12/2/2019, I observed P@l laminar flow bench ‘i with yellow staining on the
inside of the ISO-5 laminar flow workstation on the HEPA grid. Aseptic filling of drug products occurs
in this LFW. The firm could not provide documentation of the last batches of drug product produced in
this laminar flow hood.

B. On 12/2/2019, I observed yellow peeling tape on the aseptic worksurface inside of ISO-5 laminar
flow wokstations; . The tape was
fraying and half of the yellow tape line was off. The line was being used as a line of demarcation for the
aseptic operators. On 12/3/19, Methylprednisolone Acetate lot 12022019+53297 was being filled and

C. On 12/2/2019, I observed a black plastic tube inside the ISO-5 Laminar flow station
acting as a particle counter. The black plastic tubing had double sided tape around the top which was

frayed. On 12/3/19, Methylprednisolone Acetate lot 12022019+53297 was being filled and baal)

in this LFw.

OBSERVATION 2
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
are not followed.

Specifically,
A.

Observed on 12/3/2019, during the aseptic processing of Methylpredinsolone Acetate batch
12022019+53297, technician dispensed from the ie | bag onto the table top of the
laminar flow workstation and use each vial (Theoretical yield ™™ unit vials).
Your firm is not followmg your standard operating procedure document number 4.71 titled, “Aseptic
Processing Requirements and Technique” which reads in section 7.1.10, “Compounding personnel shall
not use a gloved hand to touch any product contact surfaces, but should use appropriately sterilized
utensils (e.g., forceps), as needed.”

  
 

B.

Observed on 12/11/2019 in the ISO 5 aseptic filling room, aseptic filling operator performed Pee
interventions during the ‘it filling of Glutathione batch 12102019+53365 without routinely
sanitizing hands. I observed the operator open the cabinet door of the filling machine (ISO 5) and
perform interventions at least nissan stopping and starting the machine, dispensing components in
the hopper, manipulate capped vials inside the filling machine for approximately a ae period.
Your firm is not following your standard operating procedure document number 4.71 tiled, “Aseptic

Processing Requirements and Technique” which reads in section 7.1.11, “Compounding personnel shall
change sterile gloves on a frequent basis or disinfect them routinely with OI during
prolonged compounding manipulations.”

C.

You did not perform investigations into the root cause of media fill sterility failures for media fill runs
performed in ISO 5 Laminar Flow Workstations (LAFWs) from Pe. Turbidity was
observed in the solutions. You failed to investigate the root cause for the following media fill failures
prior to producing and distributing sterile products. See four examples found below:

However, the “Summary of Validation Discrepancies” reads “there was a failure noted”. Media fill
number @ 5 is noted as failed. Your firm failed to investigate the failure per your SOP 4.80,
titled, “Validation Protocol for Aseptic Process Simulations”. It reads in section 9.1.1.1., “Any positive
units, deviations, or discrepancies must be investigated and shown to have no impact on the validation.
In addition, your firm could not provide the batch production record for this failed trial run

Your firm failed to investigate the failure per your SOP 4.80, titled, “Validation Protocol for Aseptic
Process Simulations”. It reads in section 9.1.1.1., “Any positive units, deviations, or discrepancies must
be investigated and shown to have no impact on the validation.

Failure to perform investigations into the root cause of media fill sterility failures for media fill
runs is a repeat objectionable observation listed on the FDA 483 inspection dated March 2017.

D.

All media vials from the Aseptic Process Simulation are not being incubated. For example; the Aseptic

in the batch record stated it was due to “space constraints”. Therefore, your firm selected every 20) vial

to be incubated.

        

EB.

Your firm is not following SOP 3.40 Cleaning and Disinfection in Sterile Compounding Areas, version
4 section 4.3. Quality Unit is responsible for reviewing documentation of the cleaning of the contracted
cleaning personnel performing the cleaning of the cleanroom suites and laminar flow workstations.
There is no review by signature on they cleaning logs completed by the cleaning contractor for the
months of October and November 2019. There is no Check By signature on the an

cleaning logs completed by the cleaning contractor for the months of October and November 2019.

OBSERVATION 3
There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and the failure of a batch or any of
its components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

Specifically,

A.
Deviation DEV-2018-002 investigation report details a sterility failure for five drug lots. Your firm

invalidated the initial sterility failure without adequate justification to support the probable root cause of
analytical lab error and noted no recall was necessary due to no patients had reported adverse events.
Furthermore, the investigation did not identify the organisms which caused the contamination to the
genus or species level or perform a gram stain per the OOS.

The following are the drug product batches:

Alprostadil 40mcg/Papaverine 30mg/Phentolamine 2 mg; batch lot 02052018+48999

Alprostadil 60mcg/Papaverine 30mg/Phentolamine 2 mg/Atropine 0.15 mg; batch lot 02192018+49094
Alprostadil 60mcg/Papaverine 30mg/Phentolamine 2 mg/Atropine 0.15 mg; batch lot 01152018+48848
Alprostadil 40mcg/Papaverine 25mg/Phentolamine 0.5 mg/Atropine 0.1 mg; batch lot 02212018+49131
Alprostadil 10mcg/Papaverine 30mg/Phentolamine | mg; batch lot 02262018+49157

The batches were quarantined in the MON however, they were inadvertently distributed and sent to
customers due to the label being half applied and fell off. The report stated the customers were
contacted and notified the samples were under additional testing (Contract lab testing) however, there is
no documentation of customers who were contacted and with whom your personnel spoke with. It was
also stated in the investigation report “there is no cause for concem or recall necessary as independent
testing revealed them to have been clear of contamination. Furthermore, by the time the mistake release
had been discovered, no patient had reported any adverse events” The following lots were released and
distributed to patients:

Alprostadil 60mcg/Papaverine 30mg/Phentolamine 2 mg/Atropine 0.15 mg; batch lot 02192018+49094
Alprostadil 40mcg/Papaverine 25mg/Phentolamine 0.5 mg/Atropine 0.1 mg; batch lot 02212018+49131

The following lots were rejected:

Alprostadil 40mcg/Papaverine 30mg/Phentolamine 2 mg; batch lot 02052018+48999

Alprostadil 60mcg/Papaverine 30mg/Phentolamine 2 mg/Atropine 0.15 mg; batch lot 01152018+48848
Alprostadil 40mcg/Papaverine 25mg/Phentolamine 0.5 mg/Atropine 0.1 mg; batch lot 02212018+49131

OBSERVATION 4

Employees are not given training in the particular operations they perform as part of their function,
current good manufacturing practices and written procedures required by current good manufacturing
practice regulations.

Specifically,

A.

C. Quality Systems Manager (initial ON) training file contained no documentation for reading of the
firm’s SOP’s: 5.40 “Policy on Label Control” and 2.87 “Visual Inspection of Finished Pharmaceuticals”.

OBSERVATION 5

Laboratory controls do not include the establishment of scientifically sound and appropriate test
procedures designed to assure that conform to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality and
purity.

Specifically,

A. Growth Promotion testing of the OI used in the Aseptic Process Simulations are
challenged with only two organisms; Bacillus subtilis and Candida Albicans. The testing of only two

organisms does not demonstrate the media can support growth of a wide range of microorganisms. Your
firm is not following the Policy on Aseptic Process Simulations as stated in SOP 4.72 section 8.4.8
which states the selection of 5 microorganisms.

B. Your firm has not performed an antimicrobial effectiveness study to verify that the preservative
system is effective and protects the product over its shelf life under expected conditions of use. For
example, the following drug stock solutions have a shelf life of six months and contain a preservative.
You have not verified through antimicrobial effectiveness studies the content of the preservative. In
addition, stability studies have not been provided to show the drug product is stable in its container.

Papaverine HCL; lot 10142019+53116, discard after April 11, 2020
Phentolamine Mesylate; lot 10142019+53114, discard after April 11, 2020

This is a repeat objectionable observation from the March 2017 FDA inspection.

Your firm’s manual visual inspection is inadequate and does not ensure your drug product is
contamination free prior to distribution.

1. I observed on 12/5/2019 in the cleanroom suite (ISO 7), aseptic fill technician performing visual
inspections at a metal table on finished drugs vial without assistance from light magnification
or contrasting white background. I observed the fill technician hold the vial O@9yyyand shake the
vial MY hen label the vials. The fill technician conducted visual inspection and labeling on
the following drug lots:

Alprostadil 150 meg/ml lot 12042019+53331
Papaverine HCL/Phentolamine mesylate 60mg/40mg/ml lot 12042019+53329

Alprostadil/Papaverme HCL/Phentolamine mesylate/Atropine 18mcg/1.8mg/0.2mg/0.2mg/ml _ lot
12042019+53327

Alprostadil/Papaverme HCL/Phentolamine mesylate/Atropme 40mcg/25mg/0.5mg/0.lmg/ml _ lot
12042019+53325

Alprostadil/Papaverine HCL/Phentolamine mesylate/Atropine 60mcg/30mg/2mg/0.15mg/ml lot
12042019+53323.

2. On 12/5/2019 in the visual inspection room, I observed an employee maneuver Triamcinolone
Acetonide (Preservative Free) 2 ml vials lot 12032019+53303 onto the table for labeling and
inadvertently drop a vial on the concrete floor. He picked up the vial held it up for approximately one
second to the light asked the process engineer if it was ok. The process engineer nodded and the

employee placed it back on the table for labeling. There was no additional examination of the integrity
of the glass vial. This visual inspection practice does not adhere to your firm’s SOP 2.87, titled, ‘Visual
Inspection of Finished Drug Products” section 8.5.2 that “if the inspector is uncertain about a potential
defect, the unit should be segregated and evaluated more thoroughly by another qualified inspector
and/or a Quality Unit representative...”

3. Prior to the fo ll visual inspection of Triamcinolone Acetonide (Preservative Free) 2 ml
vials lot 12032019+53303, your firm failed to measure the intensity of the light source using a calibrated

on the visual inspection machine. SOP 2.87, titled, ‘Visual Inspection of Finished Drug
Products” section 8.4 requires the measurement to be recorded in the batch production record; however,
there is no allotted space in the batch record to record this measurement.

OBSERVATION 6
The quality control unit lacks authority to fully investigate errors that have occurred.

Specifically,
A.

Your firm failed to perform investigations into “Positive” sterility results as outlined in SOP 5.30, titled,
Testing of Sterile Preparations section 8.3.1.1. and SOP 5.54, “Investigating an Out of Specification”
section 7.1.

1. Triamcinolone Acetonide 40mg/ml (Preservative Free) lot number 08272019+52841 culture result
was “Positive” for media bottle PMN) utilizing the P| sterility test method. There was no

subculture or gram staining performed. There was no out of specification investigation or deviation
performed. The lot was distributed to MA), Ffice orders.

2. Levocarnitine 500mg/ml lot number 08212019 +52824 culture result was “Positive” for media
bottles ice A handwritten note on the Accession report reads, “Plating
(subculture) was performed on sample & corresponding™ bottle; Result was negative”. However,
three culture bottles were shown positive and it is not stated by the handwritten note if all three bottles
were subcultured. Furthermore, there is no documentation of the subculturing. There is no “Review By”
Signature and date by the Quality Unit on the Sterility Test Report. There was no out of specification
investigation or deviation performed. The lot was distributed to MO office orders.

3. Levocamnitine 500mg/ml lot number 01292019+51387 culture result was Positive for M)imedia

bottles and ‘ne Handwritten note on the petty EY sterility report for bottle
notes a subculture was performed on the inoculated media bottle and results were negative.
However, there was no subculture of media bottle). There is no documentation of the

subculturing. There is no “Review By” Signature and date by the Quality Unit on the Sterility Test
Report. There was no out of specification investigation or deviation performed. The lot was distributed

te office orders.

4. Methylprednisolone Acetate (Preservative Free) lot number 02272019+51657 culture result was
Positive fo) media bottle. There was no out of specification investigation performed or
deviation report generated. There is no “Review By” Signature and date by the Quality Unit on the
Sterility Test Report. There was no subculture performed. The lot was distributed toll office orders.
The lot was distributed toa, office orders.

 
   

5. Zine Chloride 02192019+51574 culture result was Positive. There was no out of specification
investigation performed or deviation report generated. There is no “Review By” Signature and date by
the Quality Unit on the Sterility Test Report. There was no subculture performed. The lot was
distributed til office orders.

B.

Your firm failed to perform complaint investigations as outlined in SOP 5.51, Handling of Customer
Complaints and Adverse Drug Reactions.

1. Complaint number CR 2018-004 dated November 27, 2018 on the complaint log reads a patient had
went into the hospital for sepsis after injection of Testosterone cypionate lot number 09182018+50532.
The log details a review of the batch record, release testing and if there were other complaints on this

lot. The complaint log does not provide information on who the complainant is, if samples were returned
or if additional testing was performed on this lot. The complaint investigation is incomplete.
Furthermore, your firm failed to submit an adverse event reporting to the FDA as required by section 8.1
in SOP 5.51, Handling of Customer Complaints and Adverse Drug Reactions.

2. Complaint number CR-2018-003 dated May 11, 2018 on the complaint log reads a customer reported
sediment in one vial of Methylcobalamin 10mg/ml 03012019+49188. Complaint outcome reads,
“Customer was resupplied; sedimenting attributed to poor grade API reagent. There was no complaint
investigation performed and no investigation with the API supplier.

3. Complaint number CR-2017-006 dated October 22, 2018 complainant from doctor reported black
specs in “beta/beta”, no lot number reported on complaint log. Complaint outcome on log reads,
““Administrator was coring the vial septa. Not traceable to AXIA” There is no additional complaint
information or complaint investigation report regarding the review of batch records, testing records or
the manufacturing process.

4. Complaint number CR 2019-002 dated June 3, 2019 does not show a completion date on the
complaint log and appears to still be an open complaint. Complaint log reads that Betamethasone
Acetate/Betamethasone Sodium Phosphate lot 03132019+51752 is clumping. Upon review of the
complaint sample, the sample was drawn into a syringe and clumping was observed. There is no

complaint investigation into the manufacturing process, testing or formulation. “No” is marked on the
log for whether an investigation is required.

OBSERVATION 7
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically,

A.

Your firm has failed to document the electronic review of pressure differential monitoring to ensure
during production that pressure differentials are maintained in the ISO-5, ISO-6, ISO-7 and ISO-8 clean
rooms during production. SOP 7.13 titled, “Automated EM” section 9.4 requires Quality Unit to
document the EM results.

B.

Your firm has failed to investigate the environmental monitoring action limit observed for active viable
air sampled in the ISO 5 filler room, location) 1 cfu recovered. Action limit is® Wy our firm did
not follow SOP 7.11 titled, Environmental Monitoring which requires as investigation to assess product
impact when applicable.

C. Your firm has failed to perform the MO environmental monitoring in the classified cleanroom
areas after November 11, 2019 according to the environmental log book and the Quality Manager. Drug
production has continued to be manufactured in these cleanroom suites since November 11, 2019.

OBSERVATION 8
Examination of packaging and labeling materials for suitability and correctness before packaging
operations is not documented in the batch production records.

Specifically,

On 12/5/19, I observed the potential for label mix-ups when labeling of small batches were performed in
the filling clean room suite conducted on a table with 5 different drug product lots. The aseptic filling
operator had just completed a small batch. He then placed 5 small drug batches on
the table each batch had approximately filled vials. The lots were:

Alprostadil 150 mcg/ml lot 12042019+53331

Papaverine HCL/Phentolamine mesylate 60mg/40me/ml lot 12042019+53329

Alprostadil/Papaverine HCL/Phentolamine mesylate/Atropine 18mcg/1.8mg/0.2mg/0.2mg/ml lot
12042019+53327

Alprostadil/Papaverine HCL/Phentolamine mesylate/Atropine 40mcg/25mg/0.5mg/0.lmg/ml lot
12042019+53325

Alprostadil/Papaverine HCL/Phentolamine mesylate/Atropine 60mcg/30mg/2mg/0.15mg/ml lot
12042019+53323

The labels were issued without documentation, batch record or verification of the lot number by Quality
Unit. It was stated by the Process Engineer that if the batch record has not been printed then he would
just write what he has issued down on a piece of paper. Your firm is not documenting manufacturing
activities contemporaneously.

  
   

OBSERVATION 9

Each batch of drug product purporting to be sterile and pyrogen-free is not laboratory tested to
determine conformance to such requirements.

Specifically,
A.

You have not completed method suitability for the OT sterility testing Method Validation
document VAL-16-001 for your drug products tested with this sterility test method. Validation Protocol
Deviation Report #2 lists test procedures which did not meet the acceptance criteria. Your Quality Unit
has not reviewed and summarized the validation data and signed as Reviewed and Approved by.

B.

You have not completed the method suitability for the endotoxin testing using PO Assay QM
for all drug products. Currently, only three drug products have completed
method suitability.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

You did not make adequate product evaluation and take remedial action where actionable microbial
contamination was found to be present in the ISO 5 classified aseptic processing area during aseptic
production.

Specifically, actionable microbial contamination was discovered inside the ISO 5 aseptic processing
environments during (b) (4) cleanroom certifications and no evaluation of product impact was
made. For example:

a.) During the 12/11/18 (B) (4) recertification, the ISO 5 Hazardous Drug Room Biological Safety
Cabinet (BSC) Surface Sample, ID (6) (4) had one mold colony isolated on the bacterial plate. The
mold was not identified. The firm did not evaluate any products filled in the ISO 5 BSC on 12/11/18
for product impact, including but not limited to: Azacitidine 150mg.

b.) On the 01/24/19 retest, the ISO 5 Non-Hazardous Drug Room Laminar Airflow (LAF) Hood Viable

Oxaliplatin 141mg, Fluorouracil 600mg, Fluorouracil 664mg, Fluorouracil 3700mg, Bevacizumab 585mg,
and Pembrolizumab 200mg.

OBSERVATION 3
Your facility design allowed the influx of poor quality air into a higher classified area.

Specifically, the air balance between rooms is not controlled to ensure cascading flow of air between areas of
lesser classifications. For example:

COLT (°C)
| area does not seal completely when the doors on either side of (b) (4) j
The ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room is maintained at a negative pressure relative to adjacent spaces, allowing
air from the unclassified area to continuously enter the room. The differential pressure between the ISO 7
Hazardous Drug Room and the unclassified office area is not monitored. Additionally, during the transfer of
finished sterile hazardous drugs, we observed (b) (4) open at the same time. The ISO 7

Hazardous Drug Room contains the ISO 5 Biosafety Cabinet, which is used in the production of sterile
hazardous drug products, including but not limited to Leucovorin, Oxaliplatin, Fluorouracil, Gemcitabine, and
Cisplatin.

b.) The air pressure differential between the ISO 8 Ante Room and the unclassified office area has been below
the specified range of (b) (4) inches water column (” w.c.) on 39 of the 44 days between 10/09/19 and
12/05/19 for which data was recorded. Of the 39 instances, the pressure differential was measured as negative
once on 11/13/19 at -0.003” w.c. allowing air from the ISO 8 Ante Room into the ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug
Room. The ISO 8 Ante Room is used by operators performing production operations to don sterile garbing
materials prior to entering one of the ISO 7 areas and the Ante Room is also used for storage of materials used
for production operations.

c.) The air pressure differential between the ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room and the ISO 8 Ante Room has
been below and above the specified range of (b) (4) _” w.c. on 8 of the 44 days between 10/09/19 and
12/05/19 for which data was recorded. The ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room contains the ISO 5 Laminar
Airflow Hood, which is used in the production of sterile non-hazardous drug products, including but not
limited to Vancomycin, Phenylephrine, Penicillin, Ceftriaxone, and Fentanyl.

d.) The air pressure differential between the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room and the ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug
Room has been below the specified range of negative (b) (4) ” w.c. on 38 of the 44 days between
10/09/19 and 12/05/19 for which data was recorded.

e.) During the cleanroom certification performed on 12/11/18, the following air pressure differentials were out of
specification: between the ISO 8 Ante Room and unclassified office area was measured at 0.138” w.c. using a
calibrated instrument while the firm’s wall gauge reading was 0.108” w.c., and between the ISO 7 Non-
Hazardous Drug Room and ISO 8 Ante Room was measured at 0.00556” w.c. using a calibrated instrument
while the firm’s wall gauge reading was 0.044. The subsequent and most recent certification performed on
06/05/19 also had air pressure differentials out of specification: between the ISO 8 Ante Room and
unclassified office area was measured at 0.145” w.c. (-0.132” w.c. wall gauge), between the ISO 7 Non-
Hazardous Room and the ISO 8 Ante Room was measured at 0.00573” w.c. (0.01” w.c. wall gauge), and
between the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room and ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room was measured at -0.0719”
w.c. (-0.084” w.c.). The wall gauges used for daily readings have never been calibrated.

OBSERVATION 4
Your facility was designed and/or operated in a way that permits poor flow of personnel and materials.

Specifically, the design of the cleanrooms was deficient in the following ways:

a.) Smoke studies performed in the ISO 5 Biological Safety Cabinet used to produce sterile hazardous
drug products were not conducted under dynamic conditions to show unidirectional airflow during
routine production operations.

b.) HEPA filtered air supply vents and air returns are all located on the ceilings of the ISO 7 Hazardous
Drug Room, ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room, and ISO 8 Ante Room. The metal air vents are not
designed to provide unidirectional air to the rooms with air dispersing in two to four different
directions from each vent. The firm has not evaluated the air patterns in each room.

c.) The ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room, ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room, and ISO 8 Ante Room share

air handling units ((b) (4) ) and a common final HEPA filter with the unclassified office
area of the pharmacy. There are no HEPA filters located directly at the air supply vents to each ISO-
classified room.

d.) Operators entering the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room must first enter the ISO 8 Ante Room to
perform initial gowning and pass through the ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room to enter the ISO 7
Hazardous Drug Room, where additional gowning and gloves are donned. On 12/03/19, we observed
the operator go back and forth between the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room and ISO 8 Ante Room on
at least two occasions to obtain more supplies needed for production and cleaning. Upon exiting the
ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room, the secondary gowning was removed and redonned upon reentry;
however, there are no restrictions of products being made in both rooms simultaneously and there
has been no evaluation of the air patterns created by the movement between rooms.

e.) Room light fixtures located in the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room, ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room,
and ISO 8 Ante Room protrude from the ceiling and are not completely sealed around the edges.
Gaps of approximately 1/8"" in width were observed along the length of each side of the various light
fixtures in each room.

OBSERVATION 5
The segregated production areas surrounding the ISO 5 classified aseptic processing area contained
dust-collecting overhangs without adequate and frequent cleaning.

Specifically, apparent dust-like residue was observed on a sterile wipe after wiping the crevices of the metal
HEPA-filtered air supply vents in the ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room and ISO 8 Ante Room. These rooms
share the same HEPA-filtered air supply that also goes to the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room and unclassified
office area. The metal vent located closest to the ISO-classified areas located in the unclassified office area also
showed apparent dust-like residue after wiping the crevices with a sterile wipe.

OBSERVATION 6
HEPA filters were not sealed around each perimeter to the support frame.

Specifically, the firm's cleanroom certification reports indicate the room supply HEPA filters are not leak tested in
the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room, ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room, and ISO 8 Ante Room because the filters in
the housing are not clamped down. On 12/04/19, the Pharmacy Director indicated she did not believe the HEPA
filters have ever been leak tested. The ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room contains the ISO 5 BSC, which is used in the
production of sterile hazardous drug products. The ISO 7 Non-Hazardous Drug Room contains the ISO 5 LAF
Hood, which is used in the production of sterile non-hazardous drug products. The ISO 8 Ante Room is used by
operators performing production operations to don sterile garbing materials prior to entering one of the ISO 7
areas and the Ante Room is also used for storage of materials used for production operations.

The edges of the air inlet metal vents installed in the ceilings of the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room, ISO 7 Non-
Hazardous Drug Room, and ISO 8 Ante Room are not sealed to the ceilings of the rooms.

OBSERVATION 7
Personnel donned gowning apparel improperly, in a way that may have caused the gowning apparel to
become contaminated.

Specifically, on 12/03/19, after producing the hazardous drugs Gemcitabine and CISplatin in the ISO 7 Hazardous
Drug Room, we observed an operator hanging a used gown on the shelf in the ISO 8 Ante Room. When asked
about the gown, the operator indicated the gown is reused throughout the day and replaced daily. Although a
separate ""Chemo Gown"" is donned upon entry in the ISO 7 Hazardous Drug Room, there are no controls in place
to prevent reuse of the gown that was contacted with bare hands.

OBSERVATION 8
Disinfecting agents and cleaning wipes used in the ISO 5 classified aseptic processing areas were not
sterile.

Specifically, non-sterile (b) (4) is a disinfectant used for
daily cleaning of the ISO 5 Laminar Airflow (LAF) Hood and ISO 5 Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) surfaces,

","This document lists observations made by the FDA representative(s) during the inspection of your facility. They are inspectional observations, and do not
represent a final Agency determination regarding your compliance. If you have an objection regarding an observation, or have implemented, or plan to

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM (1) (WE) OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Actionable microbial contamination was present in the ISO 5 area or in adjacent areas during aseptic
production without adequate product evaluation and remedial action. Specifically, on 5/27/2019, the
response to Bacillus microbial contamination within ISO 5 Hood@l did not include testing to determine
the extent of impact nor identification and notification of all potentially impacted patients.

 

OBSERVATION 2

Personnel failed to disinfect or change gloves frequently enough to prevent contamination.
Specifically, the technician was observed to disinfect her gloves infrequently during sterile production
of TPN products on 11/18/2019. For example, she was observed to move her hands outside of the ISO
5 hood and then back into the hood without sanitization. On 11/19/2019, the technician was observed
tying out the trash bag in the large trash bin located in the ISO 7 production room, rolling the bin into
the ISO 8 anteroom, and resuming aseptic production activities in the ISO 5 hood after spraying her
hands with (6). She did not change her sterile gloves or sleeves although they had been in
contact with the trash bin. On 11/19/2019, she was also observed to spray and wipe down the foldable
step-stool, which she uses to reach within the hood during cleaning and production, without changing
her sterile gloves before resuming aseptic production activities.

 

OBSERVATION 3

Personnel engaged in aseptic processing were observed with exposed skin in critical areas. Specifically,
on 11/18/2019 and 11/19/2019, the technician was observed with her forehead exposed while leaning
significantly into the ISO 5 certified Hood MlM@during aseptic production activities.

OBSERVATION 4

Equipment, materials, and/or supplies are not disinfected prior to entering aseptic processing areas.
Specifically, materials are not adequately disinfected prior to moving them from areas of lower to
stricter classifications. Large drug components, such as , are “washed” in baskets in a
(IA loaded with (A and then partially dried using a (BAH located in the general
pharmacy area prior to being placed in the (B)(4H to the ISO 7 production room. Materials are
moved into temporary storage baskets within the ISO 7 room without disinfection. When they are used
for production, materials are placed on ISO 5 worksurfaces prior to their disinfection within the hoods.

OBSERVATION 5

Media fills were not performed that closely simulate aseptic production operations incorporating, as
appropriate, worst-case activities and conditions that provide a challenge to aseptic operations.
Specifically, the media fills consist of preparing and {4} (GNA media into} control vials and
vials intended to represent finished product, though this is not representative of the worst-case
activities such as the manual production and (BE of product in up tof syringes intended
for intracameral injections.

 

OBSERVATION 6

Disinfecting agents used in the ISO 5 area are not sterile. Specifically,
EE) is non-sterile and is routinely used for disinfection of the ISO 5 hoods and
supporting aseptic processing areas.

 

OBSERVATION 7

Pressure differentials between areas with different air classifications were not monitored prior or
during sterile drug production. Specifically, there is no verification of the pressure differentials before
or during sterile drug production. Pressure differentials are measured with(@)( manometers

ushich ara nat vicihla fram within the claanrnanm Tha valuac are daciimented#AMM: no time is

   

OBSERVATION 8

Your firm released drug product in which the strength differs from, or its purity or quality falls below,
that which it purports or is represented to possess. Specifically, the (GN and GI irrigation
solutions have failed assay testing for epinephrine since 02/2019 but they were still produced and
dispensed without resolving the failures. Additionally, testing data lacks supporting documentation
with the date of production to verify the the assigned 9-day BUD is appropriate for the irrigation
solutions.

OBSERVATION 9

The |SO-classified equipment have difficult-to-clean, particle-generating, or visibly dirty equipment or
surfaces. Specifically, ISO 5 Hood PE has a worksurface composed of laminate which is worn and
stained on the left side and has been chipped on both front corner edges. This hood is used for sterile
drug production and was the only hood in use while Hood Q8 was down from about 10/31/2019
through 12/2/2019.

 

OBSERVATION 10

ISO-5 classified areas were not certified under dynamic conditions. Specifically, unidirectional airflow is
not verified under operational conditions representative of the most challenging load and activities.
The smoke studies performed only include evaluation of manual manipulations within the hood and do
not include evaluation of a fully-loaded hood, such as with the GA equipment, which
takes up a significant amount of space and potentially interrupts the first-pass air due to the (BN
airflow hood design.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and the failure of a batch or any of
its components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

Specifically,
The firm failed to adequately investigate the following:

A. There have been seven confirmed failures for in-house sterility testing of finished sterile drug
products since October 2018 using a(b) (4) method for detection of fluorescence in
individual microorganisms ((b) (4) ). All associated batches (1218003930,
1219007440, 1219008117, 1219008696, 1219009160, 1219009289, & 1219012541) were
rejected; however, the investigations did not take into account the identity of the
contaminating microorganism(s) to determine its source. For example:

e Out-of-Specification Laboratory Investigation Report OOS 18-087-W was initiated
on 10/15/2018 for the sterility test failure of Buffered Lidocaine 1% in Sodium
Bicarbonate 8.4% (b) (4) Syringe lot number 1218003930. The potential root
cause(s) was determined to be human error; however, the investigation did not
identify the contaminating microorganism(s). The investigation was approved by
Quality Assurance 12/10/2018.

e Out-of-Specification Laboratory Investigation Report OOS 19-049-W was initiated
on 03/22/2019 for the sterility test failure of Buffered Lidocaine 1% in Sodium
Bicarbonate 8.4% (b) (4) Syringe lot number 1219007440. A definitive root

cause had not been determined but the Deviation Investigation (DV-19-312-W)
indicated the possible root cause was human error; however, the investigation did not
identify the contaminating microorganism(s). The investigation was approved by
Quality Assurance on 06/17/2019.

e Out-of-Specification Laboratory Investigation Report OOS 19-055-W was initiated
on 04/18/2019 for the sels test failure of Ob) ( hone HC] 0.2mg/mL in 0.9%
Sodium Chloride( b) (4 \b) (4) ) (4) lot number
1219008117. The potential root cause | in eee Investigation (DV-19-
385-W) was human error; however, the investigation did not identify the
contaminating microorganism(s). The investigation was approved by Quality
Assurance on 09/05/2019.

e Out-of-Specification Laboratory Investigation Report OOS 19-066-W was initiated
on 05/11/2019 for the sterility test failure of Vancomycin HCI 1.25g added to 0.9%
Sodium Chloride (b) (4) lot number 1219008696. The
potential root cause identified in Deviation Investigation (DV-19-472-W) was human
error; however, the investigation did not identify the contaminating
microorganism(s). The investigation was approved by Quality Assurance on
08/05/2019.

e Out-of-Specification Laboratory Investigation Report OOS 19-071-W was initiated
on 05/28/2019 for the sterility test failure of Glycopyrrolate 0.2mg/mL (b) (4)
Syringe(b) (4) lot number 1219009160. The potential root cause identified in
Deviation Investigation (DV-19-553-W) was human error; however, the investigation
did not identify the contaminating microorganism(s). The investigation was approved
by Quality Assurance on 08/30/2019.

e Out-of-Specification Laboratory Investigation Report OOS 19-074-W was initiated
on 05/31/2019 for the sterility test failure of Phenylephrine HCl 40mcg/mL in 0.9%
Sodium Chloride (b) (4) Syringe (b) (4) lot number 1219009289.
The potential root cause identified in Deviation Investigation (DV-19-554-W) was

human error; however, the investigation did not identify the contaminating
microorganism(s). The investigation was approved by Quality Assurance on
08/30/2019.
e Out-of-Specification Laboratory Investigation Report OOS 19-123-W was initiated
on 09/25/2019 for the sterility test failure of Me HCl 100mcg/mL in 0.9%
Sodium Chloride (6) (4) Syringe (b) (4) lot number 1219012541.
A definitive root cause had not been determined but the Deviation Investigation (DV-
19-810-W) indicated the possible root cause was human error; however, the
investigation did not identify the contaminating microorganism(s). The investigation
was approved by Quality Assurance on 10/18/2019.
Furthermore, it was noted that from January 2019 to October 2019 the firm had
approximately 105 occasions in which Personnel Exit Monitoring had exceeded the action
limit specification for zero objectionable organisms mostly concerning samples taken from
operator hoods (32 occurrences) and chests (50 occurrences); however, the firm had not
identified a potential cause for this trend until the Environmental and Personnel Monitoring
(b) (4) Trend Report which was approved by Quality on 10/29/2019 during the inspection.
Examples of the objectionable organisms recovered were Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus
aureus, Moraxella osloensis, and Roseomonas mucosa.

B. On 08/14/2019 the firm had initiated an Out-of-Specification Investigation Report OOS-19-
111-W for a potency failure for the T90 (90 days) stability sample of Heparin Sodium
10units/mL in 0.9% Sodium Chloride (b) (4) _ lot number
1219008741, result 82%, specification (b) (4)%. The OOS result was confirmed and the
firm had initiated a Deviation Investigation (DV-19-711-W) on 08/15/2019 to investigate this
failure. The firm had Na) the root cause as inconclusive and took the following
corrective actions: (b (4

_ The firm had not conducted a health hazard

evaluation of the sub-potent product nor had they notified the customers who had received
OM lots of this product with the 90 day BUD, some of which are currently within expiry.

c. On 08/16/2019, the firm initiated a Deviation Investigation Report DV-19-716-W to
espeate — within the (6) (4) (b) (4) assembly (SCA part# (Db) (4)) at the

of the (®) @) on October 21, 2019 (during the inspection) without an evaluation of this lot of
defective(b) (4)

D. The Quality Unit failed to adequately investigate consumer complaints by not evaluating
retentions samples and returned product when applicable for confirmation of the reported
complaint. For example:

e Customer Complaint Form CUS-18-189-W, dated 11/13/2018, indicated that a
customer called stating the nurse from the floor was reporting more hemorrhages on
the L&D floor than normal. They had five patients in one day hemorrhage. The
customer was requesting potency data on Oxytocin 20units added to 0.9% Sodium
Chloride 1000ml Bag lot number 1218004043. The investigation concluded that there
was no impact to product identified as the potency of lot number 1218004043 was
confirmed to be within specification via batch record review. The firm did not
conduct an evaluation of retain samples. The investigation was approved by Quality
on 12/27/2018.

e Customer Complaint Form CUS-19-028-W, dated 2/26/2019, indicated that a
customer had administered © different ba gs of Oxytocin 20units added to 0.9%
Sodium Chloride 500mL Bag lot number 1219006051 to ©) @)different pregnant
patients and in which their cervixes did not dilate after receiving this product. The
investigation concluded that there was no impact to product identified as the potency
of lot number 1219006051 was confirmed to be within specification via batch record
review. The firm did not conduct an evaluation of retain samples. On 05/22/2019 the
firm received) @nnits from lot number 1219006051 from their customer. The units
were not evaluated but instead were destroyed. The investigation was approved by
Quality on 04/03/2019.

e Customer Complaint Form CUS-19-051-W, dated 04/25/2019, indicated that a
customer stated that Oxytocin 20units added to 0.9% Sodium Chloride 1000mL Bag
lot number 1219007516 was not working on patients. The investigation concluded
that there was no impact to product identified as the potency of lot number
1219007516 was confirmed to be within specification via batch record review. The
firm did not conduct an evaluation of retain samples. The investigation was approved
by Quality on 05/20/2019.

Furthermore, the firm has had sixteen Out-of-Specification Investigations involving sub-
potent Oxytocin 20 and 30 unit products compounded from October 2018 to March 2019.
Each of these investigations confirmed the potency out-of-specification result and the
batches were rejected; however, the above mentioned complaint investigations did not
contain an evaluation of these Out-of-Specification Investigations within the investigation
summary. As a result of these investigations the firm initiated Change Control TCC#19-
073-W (3/18/2019) to update the compounding process to (b) (4)

(Oxytocin 20
units (F008446-A-W-02-05) & Oxytocin 30 units (F08544-A-W-02-04)).

OBSERVATION 2

Each batch of drug product required to be free of objectionable microorganisms is not tested through
appropriate laboratory testing.

Specifically,

A. The firm failed to adequately qualify their method for Sterility Testing via (b) (4) in that
during the method transfer, (b) (4) (4) Performance Qualification for SCA Pharmaceuticals
Windsor, CT (approved 11/28/2017, CT0051 & 01/08/2018, CT0052) the firm did not verify
each product type via(b) (4) but instead only conducted testing usin (b) (4)

conducted by
analysts. The firm has used this method routinely to test and release sterile drug product since

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1
Test procedures relative to appropriate laboratory testing for sterility are not written and followed.

Specifically, the firm's written procedures for conducting (6) (4) rapid sterility testing are deficient in
that:

1. Finished drug product (b) (4) rapid sterility test samples deemed by firm personnel to be “background

too high”, verbally defined as samples displaying more than®™™ events, are not fully examined. The firm

(b) (4) . If this

discards the sample results and the product lot is {
(b) (4) | “background too high”, the firm will (b) (4)

 

 

 

». No investigations are conducted for test deemed as “background too high”. Samples have
been deemed “background too high” approximately 23 times in the last 90 days.

Additionally, during the execution of rapid sterility sample preparation on November 4, a laboratory
analyst was observed practicing poor aseptic technique including passing their hands over open containers
and exposed samples on at least three occasions, which could lead to the introduction of microbial and
particulate contamination of the samples.

2. There is no written definition of “background too high” in the firm’s procedure, which was
verbally described as samples with more than®)@) events.

3. There are no instructions for the firm’s practice of discarding samples deemed to have
“background too high” and then (6) (4)

. The firm does not have procedures requiring eye exams for individuals that conduct review of
rapid sterility test sample results (b) (4) examination.

. Procedures do not require observance of actual positive microbial events by an analyst prior to
performance of sterility testing conducted for commercial products. During the inspection it was
observed that an individual was allowed to conduct inspection of (6) (4) rapid sterility
samples, including (b) (4) prior to the completion of activities to
demonstrate they have seen and can identify what a positive microbial event looks like (b) (4)

. For example, during the period from October 3, 2019 to October 29, 2019, a
laboratory associate was allowed to conduct finished product rapid sterility testing prior to the
associate participating in a method validation on October 29, 2019, where according to firm
management they would have seen an identified positive microbial event example for the first
time at the firm. During this time, the associate conducted test for multiple lots of product,
Cy but not limited to rapid sterility sample ID sets (6) (4), (B) (4), (6) (4)

) (4)

OBSERVATION 2
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
are not followed,

Specifically,

-& Your firm failed to follow SOP.CM.4102, Version 6 (dated: 6/3/19) entitled, “Aseptic
Processing and Technique”, Section: 6.3.2 Principles of Aseptic Technique as evidenced by
the following examples:

a. According to your(b) (4) on 10/26/19, at approximately
(b) (4) +) during the filling of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP 200mg/10mL
(preservative free), lot # SU9083A, the aseptic technique of your firm’s operator was
not adequate as they were observed opening the Luer Lock IV Syringe Cap

 

containers directly over the firm’s (6) (4) cap scoop containing caps (product
contact surface), blocking first air, then was observed opening the door to the (b) 4
) filling line and touching the feeder containing the Luer Lock IV
inge Caps with their gloved hand. In addition, from approximately (b)
Sm your firm’s operators were observed sanitizing their gloved hands | prior to
personnel monitoring of their sleeves and gloved hands (conducted at approximately

. According to your (6) (4) ), on 10/26/19, at approximately
(b) (4) ‘during the filling of Succinylcholine Chloride Injection, USP 200mg/10mL
(preservative free), lot # SU9083A an operator was observed moving rapidly within
the ISO-5 Clean Room carrying a tote containing Luer Lock IV Syringe Cap
containers. The tote and the gloved hands of the operator came in direct contact with
the sterile caps that were exposed within the(b) (4) cap scoop. The same
operator was observed tossing the Luer Lock IV Syringe Cap containers from one
tote to another within the cap loading area.

24. Your firm failed to follow SOP.CM.4928, Version 10 (dated: 9/9/19) entitled, ""Manual

sw Syringe Filling Operations Procedure"", Section: 6.6 Filling Syringes and Section: 6.7
Capping Syringes as evidenced by the following example: on 10/29/19, two technicians were
not exhibiting slow and controlled movements within the ISO-5 Hood during the filling and
stoppering of Neostigmine Methylsulfate for injection, USP 3mg/3mL (img/mL)
preservative free, lot # NE9066 within filling room, (b) (4)

. Your firm’s smoke studies are inadequate as they do not demonstrate that your hood and/or line is
designed to prevent microbiological contamination, or to provide high assurance of product sterility
as evidenced by the following examples:

a. On 7/25/19, within the firm’s ISO 5 Clean Room, #(6) (4) containing the firm’s (b) (4)
filling line, laminar air flow was not demonstrated as turbulent air flow was

observed within the smoke study videos entitled, “July 25, 2019 Bowl.MP4”, “July 25, 2019
Feeder.MP4” and July 25, 2019 Filler.MP4”.

. On 4/25/19, within the firm’s ISO 5 Hood 4% located in Clean Room (b)(4), first air from
the (6)(4)) HEPA filter was being blocked by the equipment (repeater pump) within the
hood and the video failed to demonstrate laminar airflow around the equipment when open
syringes are connected to the filling tubing. In addition, your firm fails to capture the loading
and un-loading of components by the additional operators within the ISO 5 Hood (during
operations there is a potential forb)(4) operators to be present working within the ISO 5
Hood).

OBSERVATION 3
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically,

l. Your firm failed to follow SOP.MB.4501, Version 17 (dated: 8/19/19) entitled, “Environmental
and Personnel Monitoring”, Section: 6.3.5 Personnel Sampling as evidenced by the following
example: on 10/30/19, during personnel monitoring, technicians were observed quickly tapping
their fingertips to each media plate, rather than rolling their fingers to capture the gloved hands
utilized during aseptic production. In addition, one technician was observed with wet gloves
from previously spraying them with(6) (4) prior to sampling which is inadequate and
not considered representative of aseptic production.

. Your firm’s SOP.MB.4501, Version 17 (cate 8/19/19) entitled, “Environmental and Personnel
Monitoring”, Attachment 20-Sampling for’ (b) (4); inadequate as evidenced by the following

example: surface samples are not conducted for the (b) (4) cap scooper at the completion

of the (6) (4) filling process (6) (4). The(b)(4) cap scooper is utilized to dispense
the sterile Luer Lock IV Syringe caps (product contact surface) into the cap hopper inside the

(b) (4) filling line.

OBSERVATION 4
Written procedures for sampling and testing plans are not followed for each drug product.

Specifically, your firm failed to follow SOP.QC.4301, Version 19 (dated: 8/20/19), Section: 6.5 100%
Syringe Visual Inspection as evidenced by the following example: on 10/29/19, your firm’s technician
was observed exhibiting poor technique while quickly and incompletely inverting the sterile syringes
(clear plastic) during the visual inspection process for Phenylephrine HCL Injection, 10 mL lot
#PE9194A.

OBSERVATION 5
Aseptic processing areas are deficient in that floors and walls are not smooth and/or hard surfaces that
are easily cleanable.

Specifically, your firm’s ISO-7 Clean rooms (b) (4) _) where aseptic processing is performed
contain floor drains which appear un-clean and stained. Additionally, on 10/30/19, blue painter’s tape
was observed affixed to the corner of your firm’s clean room wall (b) (4)) and glass frame covering the
gap between areas. The floor drains and blue painter’s tape cannot be easily cleaned or sanitized.

OBSERVATION 6
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for cleaning and disinfecting the room and
equipment to produce aseptic conditions.

Specifically, your firm failed to follow SOP.SR.2501, Version 18.0, Cleaning of Classified
Environments for Nephron 503b Outsourcing Facility (dated: 8/15/2019), Section 6 — Procedure, as
evidenced by the following example: on 10/28/19, during the formulation of Neostigmine, Img/mL
(3mL) lot #NE9066 it was observed that within Compounding Suite™®, Room | ™® (1SQ-7), the base
of the loading ramp leading onto the floor ‘production scale contains a black-colored substance and is
stained. The cleaning log for that suite, ; Floor Cleanroom Cleaning/Sanitization Log, (PR:
1002134), effective 8/28/2019, shows startup cleaning prior to formulation, on 10-28-2019, however the
observed growth within the classified area does not support that cleaning within the suite was adequate.

OBSERVATION 7
Established test procedures are not documented at the time of performance.

Specifically, The firm does not maintain documentation of the start, stop or elapsed time for the incubation of
rapid sterility tes Bs i _ The firm only temporarily records start and due/end times on a piece of tape on the

box holding the sample ) (4) This tape is discarded following testing. Incubation within established time
and temperature specification is important in obtaining valid product sterility results.

OBSERVATION 8

in

 

 

 

Appropriate controls are not exercised over computers or related systems to assure that changes in
master production and control records or other records are instituted only by authorized personnel.

Specifically,

1. The computer systems used to locally store sterility sample results for the firm’s (b ) (4) instruments
allows the addition and deletion of files in the directory used for storage of (b) (4) data while logged i in under
the Windows operating system’s shared general laboratory user login.

2. According to the firm’s Chief Technology Officer (b) (4) © sterility testing data is supposed to be backed up
b) (4) '; however, data file backup did not occur for one of the firm’s

(4) __ computer systems from August of 201 9 to November 4, 2019. During the time since the backup
stopped, approximately samples runs were conducted on the instrument.

3. The(b) (4) | system allows for the deletion of the audit trail on the computers. The audit trail prior to August
2019 for one of the(b) (4) computers was deleted from one of (6) (4) computer systems. The system has been
in used since (6)@).

OBSERVATION 9
There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy whether or not the batch has been
already distributed.

Specifically, the firm does not conduct investigations when finished product rapid sterility samples are deemed
“background too high”. Samples were deemed ""background too high"" approximately 23 times in the last 90 days,
with no investi zations performed. The source nor cause of the high event counts have been identified. The

DATE(S) OF INSPECTION

10/28/2019-11/12/2019*
","This document lists observations made by the FDA representative(s) during the inspection of your facility. They are inspectional
observations, and do not represent a final Agency determination regarding your compliance. If you have an objection regarding an
observation, or have implemented, or plan to implement, corrective action in response to an observation, you may discuss the objection or
action with the FDA representative(s) during the inspection or submit this information to FDA at the address above. If you have any
questions, please contact FDA at the phone number and address above.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding systems for maintaining any equipment used to control
the aseptic conditions.

Specifically,

1. Room certifications conducted on June 22, 2019 by a third-party vendor established that the
firm’s ISO7/8 classified rooms all met their intended classifications however, room certifications
were performed inadequately because they were conducted at rest and not under dynamic
conditions to simulate normal routine production. Approximately (b) (4) _ batches of
sterile injectable drugs products have been aseptically filled since June 22, 2019 in your ISO7
buffer rooms containing your ISOS hoods.

2. No smoke studies have been conducted to evaluate the unidirectional airflow in the ISOS LAFHs
under dynamic conditions. Approximately (b) (4) batches of sterile injectable drug
products have been aseptically filled in the ISOS LAFHs.

3. Your firm failed to properly review the positive pressure of the ISO7 anterooms of your
hazardous and non-hazardous sterile suites from 8/19/19 to 10/17/2019. Therefore, your firm
was not aware of the consistent loss of pressure until 10/17/2019.

OBSERVATION 2
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for cleaning and disinfecting the room and
equipment to produce aseptic conditions.

Specifically,

Your firm does not follow or record the contact times established by your disinfectant efficacy studies required to
effectively clean the ISOS LAFH/BSC and ISO7 buffer, ante and preparation rooms. On 10/28/2019, I observed
(b) (4) _ cleaning procedures and observed the sterile technician disinfect the ISOS LAFH with (b) (4) and
immediately wipe dry with a sterile wipe. Your disinfectant efficacy studies state that contact time for (D) (4)

is (b) (4) . Therefore, there is no assurance that your cleaning process using various sterile cleaning agents are
sufficient to achieve adequate levels of disinfection.

OBSERVATION 3

Reports of analysis from component suppliers are accepted in lieu of testing each component for
conformity with all appropriate written specifications, without performing at least one specific identity
test on each component.

Specifically,

Your firm failed to conduct at least one specific identity test for the following drug components in lieu of
complete testing when maintaining the supplier’s certificate of analysis:

1. Methylcobalamin, Batch/Lot Number (6)(4) used in Chorionic Gonadotropin/Methyl-B12
1000U/Ime/Iml Injection Lot #09162019@2.

2. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, USP Batch/Lot Number (6)(4) used in Chorionic
Gonadotropin/Methyl-B12 1000U/1mg/1ml Injection Lot #09162019@2.

3. Estradiol (1) (4) . Batch Number (b) (4) used in Estradiol 6mg Pellet, Lot
#082819@02.
OBSERVATION 4

There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy whether or not the batch has been
already distributed.

Specifically,

The Quality Control Unit (QCU) failed to thoroughly review batch production records for any unexplained
discrepancy. There were batch production records missing specific identification numbers of major equipment
used in production, missing pass/fail of ph calibration check, documentation of start times and stop times,
incorrect visual examination reconciliation and lack of documentation of positive pressure of the ISO7 buffer and
ISO7 preparation rooms. Batch production records with missing information was reviewed and subsequently
released by the firm's QCU.

OBSERVATION 5
Procedures describing the handling of all written and oral complaints regarding a drug product are not
established and written.

Specifically,

Your firm has a contract with (b) (4) to market, advertise and promote your sterile hormone pellets
however, your firm has not established specific written procedures to ensure that all complaint received by (6) @)
(b) (4) regarding your sterile hormone pellets are forwarded to your firm. Therefore, your firm may not
receive all written or oral complaints related to your sterile hormone pellets that need to be further investigated to
determine if there are potential quality issues of your drug products and/or reportable to FDA in the event of an
adverse drug reaction.

OBSERVATION 6

Poor sterile gowning practices may allow sterile garb to become contaminated.
Specifically,

Gowning practices observed on 10/28/2019 by a Sterile Technician and a Quality Control Technician
demonstrated that the technicians permit the sterile jump suit to repeatedly touch the floor which may contaminate
the sterile jump suit prior to entry of the ISO7 buffer room containing the ISOS LAFH. The practice of allowing
the sterile jump suit to repeatedly touch the floor was observed again on 10/29/2019.

OBSERVATION 7

Your outsourcing facility has not submitted an adverse event report to FDA in accordance with the content and
format requirements established through guidance or regulation under 21 CFR 310.305 as required by section
503B(b)(5).

Specifically,

On 09/26/2019, the firm received an unexpected possible life-threatening adverse drug reaction from the patient's
doctor regarding implementation of the following sterile pellets:

1. Sterile Testosterone Pellet 25mg, Lot #102215-02.

2. Sterile Testosterone Pellet 50mg, Lot #101415-02.

3. Sterile Testosterone Pellet 87.5mg, Lot #102215-12.
As of 10/31/2019, the adverse event reaction to these drug products have not been reported to FDA within 15
calendar days from 09/26/2019 required.

OBSERVATION 8

You compound drugs that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs within the meaning of sections
503B(a)(5) and 503(B)(d)(2).

Specifically, you compound drug products that:

a) are identical or nearly identical to an approved drug that is not on the drug shortage list in effect under section
506E at the time of compounding. distribution, and dispensing: or

b) are not identical or nearly identical to an approved drug but contain a bulk drug substance that is also a
component of an approved drug, and for which there is no change that produces for an individual patient a clinical
difference, as determined by the prescribing practitioner, between the compounded drug and the comparable
approved drug.

Examples of compounded drug products that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs include:

1. Dyclonine (mint) * Office Use* 0.5% Solution
2. Dyclonine (mint) * Office Use* 1% Solution

OBSERVATION 9

Your outsourcing facility has not submitted a report to FDA identifying products compounded during the previous
six months as required by section 503B(b)(2)(A). Specifically, the following products were compounded and not
identified on your report dated July 3, 2019:

4. HCG Methylcobalamin B12 1000IU Injection

5. Testosterone Pellets- 25mg, 37.5mg, 50mg, 100mg and 200mg

6. Estradiol Pellets- 6mg, 10mg, 12.5mg and 15mg

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM (I) (WE) OBSERVED:

1. Non-pharmaceutical grade components are used in the formulation of non-sterile drug products. Specifically,

Your firm uses non-pharmaceutical grade ((e)) (C3) as a component in the production of various strengths
of Tretinoin Topical Cream, gel, ointments and, Omeprazole Smg/mL oral suspension|(») =), was used in
the production off Mots of the compounded drug products, produced between May 10, 2019 and November 7,
2019.

2. Non-microbial contamination was observed in your production area. Specifically,

The ((s)) (4) analytical balance, Serial No{)@5) , used to weigh components of your

firm's non-sterile compounded drug products, was observed to have compromised structural integrity of the back-
panel of the inner balance chamber. Although the back-panel is not an intended product contact surface, there is
potential for particulate shedding of the back-panel material (paint chips, fibers, etc.) to enter and contaminate the
non-sterile components during weighing activities.

3. Personnel engaged in aseptic processing were observed with exposed hands. Specifically,

On 11/04/19, your firm's Pharmacist in Charge (PIC) was observed verifying (re-weighing) components, weighed

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1

Personnel engaging in aseptic processing was observed with exposed skin.

Specifically, your firm’s pharmacy manager was observed during the production the non-patient specific sterile
drug product, EPI-Shugarcaine Sw/F Ophth 1 ml/vial, Rx (b) (6) . as having his head, partially exposed facial
skin, inside LAF Hood ™®

OBSERVATION 2
Materials or supplies were not disinfected prior to entering the aseptic processing areas.

Specifically, your pharmacy manager failed to adequately disinfect materials transferred from the ISO 7
Cleanroom into LAF Hood which was later used in the production of sterile drug products. For
example, on 10/30/2019, I observed your pharmacy manager aseptically process the drug product for
""Office Use Only"", EPI-Shugarcaine Sw/F Ophth 1 ml/vial, Rx (Bb) (6). )() jm vials, Expiry
11/13/2019. While producing this lot of sterile ce roduct, I observed the following items were not
disinfected prior to entering the ISO 5 LAF Hood 4)

A. During setup for production, your pharmacy’s manager failed to disinfect the tray containing
ampules of Lidocaine 4% Pres-Free prior to entering the ISO 5 LAF hood. The ampules were
removed from the non-disinfected tray and disinfected once inside the LAF hood.

B. Your firm’s pharmacy manager was observed placing a non-disinfected “light green” plastic

container used to hold the” vials of finished sterile EPI-Shugarcaine Sw/F Ophth 1 ml/vials into
the ISO 5 LAF hood for the purpose of performing visual inspection of each vial quality.

OBSERVATION 3
Personnel touched equipment or other surfaces located outside of the ISO 5 classified aseptic processing
area with gloved hands and then engaged in aseptic processing without changing or sanitizing gloves.

Specifically, your firm pharmacy failed to disinfect sterile gloves prior to re-entry into ISO 5 LAF hood
while aseptically processing the sterile drug product, EPI-Shugarcaine Su/F Ophth | ml/vial after
collecting additional supplies in the ISO 7 Cleanroom too many times to count. At the completion of
aseptic processing, I observed your firm’s pharmacy manager pick paper off the floor, place it into the
trashcan, and return into the ISO 5 LAF hood without disinfecting and or change the sterile gloves prior
to re-entry into the ISO 5 area.

OBSERVATION 4
Personnel placed equipment/supplies in an area that blocked the movement of first pass air around an
open unit, either before or after it was filled with sterile product.

Specifically, your firm’s pharmacy manager failed to place supplies in an area, which would not inhibit
first pass airflow within LAF Hood™® during aseptic processing. For example, during the aseptic
processing of the sterile drug product, EPI-Shugarcaine Su/F Ophth 1 ml/vial, Rx (b) (6) , Lobserved
empty/filled vials and Lidocaine 4% Pres-Free 4.5 mls ampules arranged in a manner that created a
disruption in first pass airflow within the ISO 5 LAF hood.

OBSERVATION 5
The facility design was observed to allow the influx of poor quality air into a higher classified area.

Specifically, your firm failed to have adequate HEPA filter coverage in the prevention of poor quality

air from entering into your ISO 7 Cleanroom, high quality air area. For example, your firm’s cleanroom
is designed with (b) (4) (b) (4) 7 your firm’s ISO 7 Cleanroom and non-
classified radio-pharmaceutical inspection/ packaging/ shipping/ receiving/ cleaning area, which fails to
have adequate HEPA filter coverage to ensure poor air quality does not enter into the ISO 7 Cleanroom.
Additionally, your firm failed to include the(b) (4) as part of your firm’s cleanroom (b) (4)
recertification to verify air quality.

OBSERVATION 6

Disinfecting agents and cleaning pads or wipes used in the ISO 5 aseptic processing are not sterile.

Specifically, your firm is using the non-sterile cleaning product, (b) (4) within your firm’s LAF
Hood ""@ designated for the production of sterile drug product.

OBSERVATION 7

Media fills were not performed that closely simulate aseptic production operations incorporating, as
appropriate, worse-case activities and conditions that provide a challenge to aseptic operations.

Specifically, your firm procedure, Media Fill Challenge, Document # 6.36, Change # 2, documents the
use of a(D) (4)

(6) (4) Your firm’s PIC reported the manipulations and complexity performed using the kit is
representative of those performed during radio-pharmaceutical drug processing. The same kit
components were modified to simulates non-radio-pharma aseptic transfers that uses a (D) (4)

(b) (4) manipulation into syringes. The simulated media fill fail to be representative of your firm’s
non-radio-pharma aseptic processing worse-case activities and conditionst.

OBSERVATION 8

The batch production and control records are deficient in that they do not include identification of
persons performing and checking each significant step in the operation.

Specifically, your firm’s production worksheets failed to include a second verifier for critical steps of
your pharmacy’s production process. For example, during my review of the following selected
production batch records, I found only your firm’s pharmacist, who produced the drug product, was the
only firm employee who reviewed and approved the production batch/lot. Your pharmacy failed to have
a second person to verify defined critical steps within the production process that effect finished drug
product identity, strength, quality, and purity.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
are not established.

Specifically,

A) Your firm's most recent smoke study video, filmed on 6/28/2019 of in situ air pattern analysis, was not
conducted under dynamic conditions that simulate routine production, such as (b) (4) 1. TV bag
manipulation and injection of drug product into multiple sealed, sterile SmL clear vials, with (b) (4

(b) (4) Without simulating unidirectional airflow and its sweeping action over and away from a representative
operation within the laminar (b) (4) _ airflow hood, there is no assurance critical processing areas are suitable
for aseptic manufacturing of sterile drug products.

B) On 8/28/19, I observed your compounding technician allow vials and tubing lines to be positioned
into the path of unidirectional “first air” during the vial filling process of Lidocaine HCl w/Bupivacaine
HCl Injection USP, Lot No. C08281901.

C) On 9/24/19, I observed your compounding technician allow gloved hand and vial to be positioned
into the path of first air during the vial filling process of Lidocidex 5mg/10mg/1.5mL Injection, Lot No.
CO9241901. The(b) (4) HEPA filtered “first air” of the vial's filling surface/septum and needle was
disrupted by the technician's gloved finger and vial during needle insertion and during the drawing up of
dexamethasone into the syringe.

D) On 9/24/19, I observed your technician wipe down a sterile needle with a sterile (b) (4) prep pad
and then proceed to pull up®™ milliliters of lidocaine into a sterile syringe. The ®mL of lidocaine was
later commingled with dexamethasone in a 1,.000mL IV bag, in compounding Lidocidex
5mg/10mg/1.5mL Injection, Lot No. CO9241901.

OBSERVATION 2
Disinfectant contact time (also known as ""dwell time"") and coverage of the item being disinfected were
insufficient to achieve adequate levels of disinfection.

Specifically,

The(b) (4) dwell time of your(D) (4) is neither recorded in a cleaning record nor correctly identified
within your (b) (4) Cleaning Procedure of Cleanroom, SOP 4.13.

OBSERVATION 3

You compound drugs that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs within the meaning of
sections 503B(a)(5) and 503B(d)@). Specifically, you compound drug products that: are not identical or
nearly identical to an approved drug, but contain a bulk drug substance that is also a component of an
approved drug, and for which there is no change that produces for an individual patient a clinical
difference, as determined by the prescribing practitioner, between the compounded drug and the
comparable approved drug.

Examples of compounded drug products that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs
include:

e JFE-PG20 (alprostadil injection)

equipment to produce aseptic conditions.

Specifically,

A) Following the cleaning of classified laminar flow hoods/biosafety cabinets and clean rooms, your firm does
not require a visual inspection to check that the cleaning has been completed and that it was effective. With any
type of cleaning there needs to be some type of verification process in place.

During inspection walk-through on September 9"", I noted the following:

1) An accumulation of cleaning residue from present and past cleanings, was found in LFH Cleanroo:
The residue was located in the back, right hand corner of the LFH
(6)(4) YY) In addition, small eee than the size of a Washington quarter) were observed in the

(6)(4) side paneling (6) (4))) LFHs HOG and #

2) A small piece of plastic (1/2-inch x 1/8 inch) was observed stuck in the (B)(@)ININ front grill of BSC 4

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile are not
established, written and followed.

Specifically,

(A) Operators were observed contacting surfaces such as the handles to the ( 0) (4 _ i doors in the ISO 7
non-hazardous cleanroom with gloved and ungloved hands. Operators also contacted surfaces in the ISO
7 anteroom with gloved and ungloved hands.

(B) Smoke studies performed in the ISO 5 hoods under dynamic conditions were not representative of
normal production operations using the repeater pump and did not simulate the production of total
parenteral nutrition (TPN). The smoke studies were conducted in empty hoods, and only basic
manipulations were simulated.

(C) During production, the lid of the trash can was observed to be up blocking the path of air exiting of ISO 5
laminar airflow hood (Hood Left) , which has the potential to create turbulent airflow within the ISO 5
hood.

(D) The firm has not conducted media fills simulating the TPN production process.

 

OBSERVATION 2
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically,

(A) The firm does not routinely perform viable and nonviable environmental sampling in classified rooms or
hoods during the production of drug products prepared pursuant to patient-specific prescriptions.

Additionally, the door handles of the cleanroom, the handles of the (b) (4 | door, and the
computer keyboards in the anteroom and(b) (4) room, which are frequently touched with gloved and
ungloved hands during operations, are not included i in the firm’s environmental monitoring program
without justification.

(B) The firm’s personnel monitoring program does not include an appropriate schedule for monitoring the
gloves and gowns of the operators involved in the production of patient-specific products during or
cag after r completion of aseptic operations.

(C) Large (BD) (4 ee | between ISO 7 anteroom and unclassified area are not interlocked and both doors

can be opened at the same time.

   

      

OBSERVATION 3

Acceptance criteria for the sampling and testing conducted by the quality control unit is not adequate to assure
that batches of drug products meet appropriate statistical quality control criteria as a condition for their
approval and release.

Specifically, your firm’s product inspection process is deficient in that you do not always perform 100% visual
checks against a contrasting background of your sterile drug preparations and repackaged drug products prior to
release. For example, the following lots of product were released by your Quality Unit without 100% visual
inspection:

; ae
Product Name Lot # Exp. Date a ER | Sy
Size | Inspected | Inspected
Norepinephrine Bitartrate 8 mg in 2
ae a aa 190619-004 | 09/17/2019 22%

Oxytocin 30 Units in 0.9% Sodium
Chloride 500 mL. 190626-015 | 09/24/2019

Phenylephrine HCI 1000 mcg in
0.9% Sodium Chloride 10 mL

 

190617-011 | 09/15/2019

|
Succinylcholine Chloride 100 mg in 181022-013 | 01/20/2019 (b) (4)
5 mL Syringe ——

 

Additionally, visual inspection of the drug products packaged into cassettes (Hydromorphone HCI 10 mg in 0.9%
Sodium Chloride 50 mL PCA (0.2 mg/mL); Morphine Sulfate 50 mg in 0.9% Sodium Chloride 50 mL PCA) were
inspected with labels covering two faces of the cassettes.

OBSERVATION 4
Testing and release of drug product for distribution do not include appropriate laboratory determination of
satisfactory conformance to the final specifications prior to release.

Specifically, the batch release testing for drug products with large batch sizes are only tested for potency,
sterility, and endotoxin. The firm does not routinely test for pH and subvisible particulates as part of batch
release testing.

OBSERVATION 5
Written specifications for laboratory controls do not include a description of the sampling and testing
procedures used.

Specifically,

(A) The firm does not have an established procedure on collection of personnel monitoring samples. On
8/20/2019, the pharmacist was observed swabbing different locations of the operator’s gown using
cotton swabs, and then streaking the samples on(E

(B) The firm does not have an established procedure describing how culture media plates should be read.
On 8/22/2019, the pharmacist reported no growth for all (D ) plates of personnel monitoring and
environmental monitoring samples collected on 8/20/2019 during Oxytocin 30 Units in 0.9% Sodium
Chloride 500 mL (Lot # 190820-010) production. However, one (1) colony was observed on the edge of
the il plate for the sample collected from the (6)(4) area of the operator’s gown.

 

 

OBSERVATION 6
Adequate ventilation is not provided.

Specifically, there is no HEPA filter in the ceiling of the anteroom and non-hazardous buffer room. The air from
the air handling unit (AHU™) travels through a remote HEPA filter located in the ceiling above an unclassified
room and then travels sone ductwork and enters the ISO 7 non-hazardous cleanroom and ISO 7 anterooms
through air supply grills in the ceiling. There is inadequate control, maintenance, and assessment of the
cleanliness of the ductwork leading from the remote HEPA filters to the air supplies located in the ceiling of the
ISO 7 anteroom and ISO 7 non-hazardous cleanroom.

OBSERVATION 7

Employees are not given training in the particular operations they perform as part of their function, current
good manufacturing practices and written procedures required by current good manufacturing practice
regulations.

Specifically,
(A) The firm’s aseptic gowning qualification program does not include assessment of the ability of the
cleanroom operator to maintain the quality of the gown after performance of gowning procedures.
(B) The firm does not have a training program for the collection of personnel monitoring samples.
(C) The firm does not have a training program for reading culture media plates.

OBSERVATION 8
Clothing of personnel engaged in the manufacturing, processing, packing and holding of drug products is not
appropriate for the duties they perform.

Specifically,

(A) Personnel were observed handling the sterile gown with ungloved hands and donning subsequent
gowning components without hand sanitization.
(B) Sterile gowns are reused when operators prepare products pursuant to patient specific prescriptions.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

You did not make adequate product evaluation and take remedial action where actionable microbial
contamination was found to be present in an area adjacent to the ISO 5 classified aseptic processing area
during aseptic production.

Specifically, you failed to present any documentation that the pharmacy has adequately investigated or
taken remedial action to control objectionable organisms found in the ISO 7 Clean rooms.

A. Routine environmental monitoring done during production on 5/13/2019, resulted in an airborne
viable recovery of 2 CFU/m? of “Inpex (mold)” in the Chemo Room. You received the May 2019
environmental monitoring report on 5/21/2019 and you did not respond to the excursion until a
(2)@5) of the Chemo Room was performed on 5/24/2019. You continued to produce in the
ISO 5 hoods from 5/21/2019 to 5/23/2019 before performing|(*) |) of the Chemo Room.
For example, you produced the chemotherapy treatments Carboplatin 623 MG in NS 250 MLS
and Irmotecan 300 MG IV D5W500 on 5/21/2019 and Oxaliplatin 160 MG in DSW 250 MLS on
5/22/2019. You did not investigate the root cause of the excursion and assess the potential impact
on drug products produced during that period.

B. Routine environmental monitoring done during production on 7/23/2019, resulted in an airborne
viable recovery of 3 CFU/m’ of “Irpex (mold)” fungal growth in the Center of the Chemo Room.
During the environmental monitoring you produced the drug Palonosetron 25MG/S5ML IV. You
received the July 2019 environmental monitoring report on 07/30/2019 and you failed to
investigate the root cause of the microbial contamination, implement corrective actions, or assess
the potential impact on drug products produced during that period.

C. Routine environmental monitoring done on 8/08/2018, resulted in an airborne viable recovery of
1 CFU/m? of “Aspergillus fumigatus (mold)” in the center of the Chemo Room and a surface
viable recovery of 2 CFU/25cm* of gram-negative rod bacteria “Methylobacterium (bact, GNR)”
in the wash sink counter of the Ante Room. You received the environmental monitoring report
on 8/15/2018 and the next/(®)) 5) of the Chemo Room was performed 9 days later on

implement corrective actions. In addition, you failed to present any assurance objectionable
organisms present in the ISO 7 Ante Room are not transferred to the (4) ISO 7

Chemo Room from personnel movement between the two rooms.

OBSERVATION 2
Your facility design allowed the influx of poor quality air into a higher classified area.

B. You do not monitor the pressure differential between the ISO 7 Ante Room and the ISO 7
Chemo Room. On 07/22/2019, it was observed that the differential pressure gauge between the
two rooms was not operating properly, and the needle on the pressure gauge was resting on the

 

pin below the pressure gauge’s minimum scale reading of 0.0 inches of water

. You have also been documenting a reading of -0.01 inches of
water as the pressure reading between the ISO 7 Chemo Room and ISO 7 Ante Room on your
(5/5) “Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure Log,” which is a reading below the capability of
your differential pressure gauge. The documented pressure reading does not indicate the actual
daily pressure differential between the ISO 7 Ante Room and the ISO 7 Chemo Room. Instead, -
0.01 inches of water pressure is documented, which was the differential pressure between the
two rooms when the pressure between the rooms was last balanced approximately one year ago.

C. You failed to appropriately monitor the pressure differential between the ISO 7 Clean Room and
the ISO 7 Chemo Room. You document 0.01 inches of water as the pressure reading between the
ISO 7 Clean Room and ISO 7 Chemo Room on youl() Ca} “Temperature, Humidity, and

D. On 08/05/2019, the pharmacy replaced the pressure differential gauge between the ISO 7 Ante
Room and the ISO 7 Chemo Room. On 08/05/2019, it was observed that the pressure gauge
between the two rooms indicated an Ante Room pressure of 0.025 inches of water

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1

Personnel donned gowning apparel improperly, in a way that may have caused the gowning apparel to
become contaminated.

Specifically,

A. On 07/30/2019, I witnessed your firm’s pharmacy technician’s failure to cover
exposed skin around the forehead and eyes while producing sterile drug products in your
ISO 5 laminar airflow hood, brand name ""(B) (4) ""serial number (Db) (4)
model ) @)_ Your pharmacy technician’s eye and forehead areas entered the ISO 5 sterile
environment while producing sterile injectable drug products.

Your firm’s pharmacy technician produced the following three sterile drug products on
07/30/2019, Chorionic Gonadotropin 5,000 U/mL Solution, Lot #07292019:92@845,
Quantity ©) @) Testosterone Cypionate (Grapeseed Oil) 40 mg/mL Oil Injection

200 mg/mL Oil Injection Solution, Lot #07302019:67@1, Quantity (B) (4).

B. On 07/30/2019, I witnessed your firm’s pharmacy technician’s failure to utilize clean
non-sterile booties throughout the day while performing sterile production tasks. Your
firm’s pharmacy technician exited the sterile suite and anteroom multiple times and
donned the same non-sterile booties three times throughout the day. These same non-
sterile booties were stored on the floor of the anteroom when not in use. While sterile
gowning, your pharmacy technician’s sterile gown’s draw strings came in contact with
the reused non-sterile booties. These same draw strings were tied in front of her torso and
she continued to produce drug products and clean the ISO 5 area with the draw strings
entering the sterile environment.

C. On 07/30/2019, I witnessed your firm’s pharmacy technician’s failure to utilize clean
non-sterile gowns in your firm’s non-sterile production areas. Your employees reuse non-
sterile gowns for approximately [)@) to oe days in a row, or according to your
pharmacy technician, “until they get really dirty”. On 07/30/2019, your firm’s pharmacy
technician produced the non-sterile drug product
Methylcobalamine/Methionine/Inositol/Choline 1/25/50/50, Rapid Dissolve Tablets, Lot
#06192019:74@15, Quantity (0) (4) utilizing a reused non-sterile gown.

OBSERVATION 2

You produced hazardous drugs without providing adequate containment and segregation to prevent
cross-contamination.

Specifically,

On 07/30/2019, I witnessed your firm’s failure to secure the entry door to your (b) (4)
(6b) (4) —_ area. Your firm utilized what appeared to be a stack of white napkins to prop
up the door to your (: area while producing
Methylcobalamine/Methionine/Inositol/Choline 1/25/50/50, Rapid Dissolve Tablets, Lot
#06192019:74@15, Quantity. The door to your firm’s negative pressure (b) (4)
area has fallen twice and your firm has not performed any risk assessment after each
occurrence. Your firm does not maintain any maintenance records for said door.
According to your pharmacist-in-charge, your firm's(b) (4) area is used

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1
The quality control unit lacks the responsibility and authority to approve and reject all drug products.

Specifically,

The Quality Unit does have responsibility and authority to approve and reject all drug products; However, drug
product lots found to be associated with faulty connectors resulting in stainless steel corrosion particulates were
not always rejected.

For example, (6b) (4) Injectable drug product lots produced from on or about January — February 2018 were
investigated due to a higher incidence of particulate rejects found during (b) (4) _ visual inspection. The
firm’s investigation into these particulates ultimately determined the root cause to be associated with corroded
(b) (4) within connectors used to connect the (b) (4) drug product vessel to the (B) (4) setup and/or
filling line. Drug product lots produced during this time were not always rejected.

OBSERVATION 2

Investigations of an unexplained discrepancy and a failure of a batch or any of its components to meet
any of its specifications did not extend to other batches of the same drug product and other drug
products that may have been associated with the specific failure or discrepancy.

Specifically,

The firm’s investigation SOP-0980, Rev 000, “Conducting cGMP Investigations” states in section 7.3.1.2 to
assess the impact on other processes, procedures, products, or patients, however, investigation reports reviewed
do not always document the assessment of whether this requirement to extend the investigation to other batches of
the drug product and/or other drug products which may have been similarly affected was performed.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically,

A) On 07/18/2019 during the production of(6) (4). 2mg/0.05mL for Injection, the “Pharmacist in Charge” was
observed taking a fingertip sample from a gloved hand that was still wet following disinfection with sterile ©) @),
, before production began.

B) During review of your “Finished Product Sterility Testing” records which includes both environmental and
personnel monitoring data from 1 1/30/2017-05/13/2019, approximately ""S samples taken from inside the ISOS
LAFH were positive for growth. For example:

1) 11/30/2017 touch plate was positive for growth.

2) 12/04/2017 settling plate was positive for growth.

3) 06/1 1/201 8 touch plate was positive for growth.

4) 08/17/2018 settling plate was positive for growth.

5) 10/19/2018 (positive for growth, plate type not identified)

No action was taken per SOP 08-004 “Environmental Monitoring-Microbial” and no alert level is established to
prevent the possible contamination of sterile drug products (This is a repeat observation from a previous
inspection).

C) The system for routine environmental monitoring of your classified zones, such as surface sampling, is
currently conducted on (6) (4) in the LAFH and following (b) (4) cleaning as described in SOP 05-
001. However, prior to 02/02/2019 no records could be provided that demonstrates a specific sampling plan
utilized for all ISO classified rooms beyond (6) (4) viable air sampling.

D) Non-viable air sampling is not conducted during production (This is a repeat observation from a previous
inspection).

E) The (b) (4) into room (b) (4)”, an unclassified room utilized
during the production of sterile drug products, does not undergo routine environmental monitoring.

F) Alarm systems to monitor for potential breaches in air quality are currently not employed.

 

OBSERVATION 2
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
did not include adequate validation of the aseptic and sterilization process.

Specifically,

A) SOP 11-006 (b) (4) Validation” was updated and implemented on 07/02/2019 to include a biological
indicator. However, there is no documentation to establish load mapping studies have been conducted.

B) Your firm has not validated any depyrogenation process for sterile glassware used in the production of “High-
Risk” sterile drug products.

C) Your firm is using preservatives for sterile products produced as “multi dose”. However, there is no data to
establish products using said preservatives have been tested to demonstrate efficacy. (This is a repeat
observation from a previous inspection).

OBSERVATION 3
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for cleaning and disinfecting the equipment
to produce aseptic conditions.

Specifically,

On 07/18/2019 during the production of(b) (4) 2mg/0.05mL for Injection, I observed the use of sterile wipes
rendered non-sterile having been left open on top of the LAFH for an unknown period prior to production. These
wipes were subsequently used to clean inside the ISOS zone and to clean equipment introduced into the ISOS
zone throughout production.

OBSERVATION 4

There is no written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products.

Specifically,

All stability data for your sterile products was requested in support of extended “Beyond Use Dates” used at your
firm. Provided were “Technical Reports” which your firm established to support the use of extended BUD’s.

A) Data provided supports sterility testing; no potency testing was conducted.

B) Accelerated studies were either not conducted or data not provided that demonstrates there are no degradant
products formed or potency altered under such conditions.

C) Not all products have data to support the use of extended BUD’s.

 

OBSERVATION 5
Each batch of drug product purporting to be pyrogen-free is not laboratory tested to determine
conformance to such requirements.

Specifically,

All finished sterile drug products reviewed undergo sterility testing at (b) (4) prior to release. However,
not all sterile drug products are tested to ensure they are pyrogen-free. For example:

1. Dexamethasone 400mcg/0.1 Injection, Lot #: 201804091 was not tested for endotoxin prior to distribution.

2. Lidocaine 1%/Phenylephrine 1.5% Solution PF, Lot #: 201806111 was not tested for endotoxin prior to
distribution.

(This is a repeat observation from a previous inspection).

 

OBSERVATION 6
Testing and release of drug product for distribution do not include appropriate laboratory determination
of satisfactory conformance to the identity and strength of each active ingredient prior to release.

Specifically,
Your firm does not conduct potency testing for any finished drug products prior to distribution. For example:

1) Ephedrine sulfate Smg/mL Injection-SmL Syringe, Lot #: 201810191 & Lot #: 201903132 was distributed
without potency data.

2) Methylcobalamin 5mg/mL Injection Solution MDV, Lot #: 201901312 was distributed without potency data.
3) Dexpanthenol 250mg/mL Injection Solution MDV, Lot #: 201902012 was distributed without potency data.

(This is a repeat observation from a previous inspection).

OBSERVATION 7
Written records are not always made of investigations into unexplained discrepancies.

Specifically,

You firm has not established alert levels or initiated investigations into repeated microbial incursions into the
ISOS classified zone. From 11/30/2017-05/13/2019 approximately 15 microbial incursions were reported in your
ISOS LAFH. No action was taken until 12/05/2018 with the initiation of CAPA Report #: 2018-001. Incursions
into the ISOS LAFH continued after completion of the investigation conducted for CAPA Report #: 2018-001, for
example:

1) 03/01/2019 touch plate positive for growth.
2) 05/13/2019 touch plate positive for growth.

No follow up investigations have been conducted to determine the cause of continued microbial incursions into
the ISOS LAFH.

OBSERVATION 1

There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy whether or not the batch has been
already distributed.

Specifically,

A. Your firm failed to investigate the potential sources or causes of particles, fibers, and other
defects observed during the visual inspection of finished drug products that were intended
to be sterile. A review of the particulate rejection logs from 2019 showed at least out of
batches were identified with over units rejected due to cracks, leaks, fibers, or other defects.
Examples include:

Size Units Distributed

fibers out of

black speck; released
foreign object ;

AMENDMENT 2
Succinylcholine SUC030719SVEC cracks; out of
Chloride leaking units
released
20mg/ml sterile black speck; ee
syringe foreign object distributed

 

B. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate sterility test failures and to identify the
contaminating organism. For example, sterility failures for the following pre-filled syringe lots:
z MOR022718IJDSC morphine sulfate 2 mg/ml for injection 1 ml in 3 ml syringe on 3/6/2018.

il. MOR022718IJDSD morphine sulfate 2 mg/ml for injection 1 ml in 3 ml syringe on 3/6/2018.

iil. MOR032318LMDSC morphine sulfate 2 mg/ml for injection 1 ml in 3 ml syringe on 3/29/2018.
iv. HYD032218SVDSC hydromorphone HC! 1mg/ml for injection 1 ml in 3 ml syringe on 4/5/2018.
V. MOR032618IJDSA morphine sulfate 4 mg/ml for injection 1 ml in 3 ml syringe on 4/5/2018.

As part of this investigation (CAPA 18003) you did not culture and identify the objectionable organisms
from the original sample or from any additional samples. These pre-filled syringes were dosed from

derived from naster non-sterile bulk lots. CAPA 18003 did not assess sources of
contamination recovered in the drug preparation environment (for example see D below) or in
components such as excipients, API, bulk non-sterile, bulk sterile sub-lots, or syringes. By failing to
identify the contaminating organism(s) you could not assess the origin of these sterility failures and
therefore, potentially failed to implement adequate corrective and preventive actions. You determined
that the pre-filled syringes and associated locking caps, not designed as extended storage container
closures, were the root cause. However, your investigation into the referenced sterility failures was
inadequate, therefore your root cause determination may be unfounded. This investigation went on from
3/7/2018-4/12/2018 while at least of drug products were released and distributed by your
QCU.

AMENDMENT 2

C. Your firm failed to investigate the root cause of potency test failures. Your firm repeatedly
reprocessed batches or modified the drug product formulations without determining the root
cause of potency failures. A review of the Quality Related Event (QRE) log showed that between
January 2017 and April 2019, approximately lots of drug products were reprocessed and/or
reformulated due to out of specification test results for potency. Examples include:

Description

05/04/17 Glycopyrrolate in-process The measured potency was 108.1% which was
0.2mg/ml lot potency OOS outside the specification range | The
GLY042517SVAB QRE 17039 formula worksheet was reviewed, and it was
noted the formula is designed to deliver of

glycopyrrolate. The previous two batches
prepared were within specification. The formula
was modified to deliver. of the active

ingredient and the lot was reprocessed.
07/25/17 Trimix in-process The measured potency of prostaglandin was

40mcg/30mg/2mg/ml potency OOS 122.1% which was outside the specification
lot QRE 17066 range The formulation was designed
PPP071217LMDS to deliver of prostaglandin and of
phentolamine. The formulation was modified to
deliver prostaglandin and the batch was
reprocessed.
01/30/19 Trimix in-process Prostaglandin potency was measured at 120.9%
al 10mcg/30mg/I1mg/ml potency OOS (specification The bulk drug was sent
lot QRE 19012 for destruction. No investigation was performed
PPP011019SVVA to determine the possible root cause.

 

D. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate environmental monitoring failures. Your firm
failed to identify the potential sources or root causes of recurrent contamination events and did

AMENDMENT 2

not extend the investigations to determine whether other batches (for example see B above) of
drug product intended to be sterile might have been impacted. For example, per CAPA 18004
(05/23/2018), Burkholderia species were recovered from multiple settle plates (passive air) and
one fingertip sample collected in ISO 5 Laminar Air Flow (LAF) hoods between 03/22/18 and
05/29/18 during production of non-sterile bulk lots or sterile sub lots of drug products intended
to be sterile.

Sa mple

 

Your investigation established that the contamination was not localized to a specific laminar
flow hood, operator, or product. However, the investigation was not extended to a review of
potential contamination in the cleanrooms or from other sources. The investigation was not

AMENDMENT 2

extended to determine whether other batches of drug products intended to be sterile may have
been impacted.

* Out of the vials of Potassium Chloride lot that were released, vials were
distributed to a customer on 05/11/20198.

E. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate complaints. Your pharmacist received a call-in
complaint on 1/6/2017 from a clinic/client after using glycerin 72 % in 20 ml vials for injection.
The complaint was concerning 4 cases of minor hematuria (blood in urine) after procedures
using glycerin 72 % in 20 ml vials for injection prepared by your firm over the course of 4
months. You identified that two lots of glycerin 72 % in 20 ml single dose vials (SDV) for
injection were sent to this customer at two separate locations. Specifically, the customer was sent

vials of GLY083016MMAB and vials of GLY121416LJKT for a sub-total of| vials to
each location. This totals vials of glycerin 72 % in 20 ml vials for injection. The referenced
report was assigned the quality related event (QRE) number 17003 and was logged as a
complaint in your firm’s log. There was no documentation related to an investigation into the lots
used by each patient. No complaint samples were collected and no retain samples were
documented as examined. Each patient was also not identified as a separate complaint and
investigated independently. An evaluation was not made or documented to establish if hematuria
reactions were unexpected adverse events or if the primary focus of your investigation was on
the aspects of the formulation and not injury to the patients. The complaint was closed on
2/24/2017 by your quality control unit.

This is a repeat observation from the 2014 and 2016 inspections.

AMENDMENT 2

OBSERVATION 2
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding air supply that is filtered through high-efficiency
particulate air filters under positive pressure.

Specifically,

(1) HEPA filters in ISO 5 hoods used to prepare drug products purported to be sterile appeared to
be visibly stained. On 05/01/2019, I (JEK) observed the preparation of the drug product bulk
orphenadrine_ citrate 30 mg/ml lot and the sterile  sub-lots

. and . in Hood in cleanroom! (CR! The
HEPA filter in appeared to have stains and discoloration. I (JEK) also observed what
appeared to be stains on the HEPA filter in Hood in cleanroom |

(2) During production of orphenadrine citrate 30mg/ml bulk lot and sub-lots
and. . I (JEK) observed open air vents between CR!
and the unclassified sterile preparation area. I (JEK) also observed open vents in ISO 7
cleanrooms and hat opened to unclassified areas. These vents were not appropriate for
their intended use.

(3) Smoke studies performed in February 2019 were deficient in that the camera angle or the
amount of visible smoke made it difficult to visualize the air flow patterns videotaped under
dynamic conditions. For example, insufficient smoke was introduced over the vials being filled
in biosafety cabinet’ (BSC Insufficient smoke was introduced into || to permit
visualization of the airflow patterns while dosing syringes. This is a repeat observation from
the 2016 inspection. Furthermore, the February 2019 smoke studies demonstrated that air arced
upward as it flowed out of hoods | © and The irregular
delivery of smoke into the ISO 5 areain CR’ makes it difficult to ascertain the airflow pattern.

(4) The most recent certification of the cleanrooms on 02/14/19-02/15/19 was performed at rest.
Certification of the ISO 5 zone in cleanroom was also performed at rest.

AMENDMENT 2

(5) The ISO 5 zone in cleanroom) (CR © is not fully covered by HEPA filters in the ceiling. The
ISO 5 zone is separated from the ISO 7 CR by | ~ .
the stainless-steel table on which the filling machine ( )
rests. An operator must enter the ISO 5 zone to set up the filling machine (install stopper
hopper, filling needle, tubing set), to load trays of sterile vials for filling, to perform
interventions during filling, and to remove trays of filled and stoppered vials. Sterile vials are
opened in the ISO 5 area.

(6) On 05/20/2019, I (DH) observed classified and unclassified areas:
(a) — the ISO 7 cleanroom and the unclassified buffer room
containing the sink and dishwasher used to clean glassware. This _ is used to bring items into
the cleanroom; (b)) | the ISO 7 cleanroom (CR and the unclassified
sterile prep area is used for finished drug products exiting CR This cleanroom is used to enter
the hazardous chemical preparation room, which is maintained at negative pressure relative to
CR (c) the ISO 7 cleanroom) CR’ and unclassified visual inspection
area. This) is marked “Do Not Use” and is blocked by shelving in the unclassified room. All

do not have HEPA filtered air supplies.

(7) A damper was installed in the door between the ISO 8 anteroom and unclassified buffer room
containing the sink. The damper consists of a hole approximately 15cm in diameter with a flap.

(8) In-house test with a performed in November 2018 demonstrated stagnant
air near the ceiling of the ISO 8 anteroom (gowning room). Between 01/05/2018 and
04/29/2019, fungal and spore-forming microbes were isolated from active air samples collected
in the anteroom including Aspergillus astroafricanus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alicyclobacillus
acidoterrestris, and Geobacillus toebii. As part of a corrective action, vents and door sweeps
were added to the bottom of the door between the anteroom and unclassified buffer room. In
January 2019 a fan was installed to increase airflow through the HEPA filter in the anteroom
ceiling, but the anteroom and HEPA filter were not recertified until 02/14/2019.

AMENDMENT 2

OBSERVATION 3
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be sterile
are not established, written and followed.

Specifically,

(1) Vials filled with drug products that are intended to be sterile and stoppered on the |
machine are moved from the ISO 5 area into the ISO 7 clean room (CR for capping and
crimping. The stoppering arm on the machine broke on 11/26/2018 and was not
repaired until 01/24/2019. Batches filled on the | during this time were
stoppered. There are no controls in place to ensure applied stoppers are fully seated
before the vials are transferred to the ISO 7 cleanroom. Caps are applied to filled
stoppered vials __ The caps are crimped using a non-sterile tool. Examples of product lots
filled on the between 12/2018 and 01/2019 include:

Lot SOD121118SVVA sodium bicarbonate 8.4 % for injection

Lot SOD121218S¥IJVA sodium bicarbonate 8.4 % for injection

Lot SOD121318SVVA sodium bicarbonate 8.4 % for injection

(2) Media fill batch records do not include documentation of all interventions performed. Therefore,
there is no assurance that your media fill is representative of your filling operations. For

example, on 11/06/2018, media fill lot, included stoppering of vials
filled on the The media fill protocol/report did not contain documentation of all
interventions nerformed_and did not specify whether stoppering was performed using
OBSERVATION 4
AMENDMENT 2

The responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit are not in writing and fully
followed.

Specifically,

(1) Batches were released and distributed to patients without review and approval by the QCU.
Examples of 503A batches approved and released with pharmacist signature. This includes
batches released without endotoxin and sterility testing.

(2) Vendor Qualification of suppliers is deficient. SOP for vendor qualification does not include a
complete supplier qualification program and there is no requirement to verify evidence obtained
in the questionnaire.

(3) Your Quality Unit failed to establish a specification for air velocity for air passing through
HEPA filters in the Laminar Airflow Hoods and in the cleanrooms. All smoke studies have not
been received or evaluated that were performed in 2/2019. These were also not evaluated at the
time performed.

OBSERVATION 5
Each batch of drug product purporting to be sterile and pyrogen-free is not laboratory tested to
determine conformance to such requirements.

Specifically, on 2/28/2019, your prepared the sterile drug product 550 ml in ON-Q pump bupivacaine 0.125%
(125 mg/ml) preservative free for injection with the beyond use date of 3/9/2019 lot BUP022819NREC to fill the
prescriptions for one pump and also for one pump to be used as a pain block for shoulder
arthroscopy. There were no tests performed for sterility and endotoxins and no visual check for particles. These
sterile prepared drugs were distributed to patients for use on 2/28/2019. In addition to not performing this testing
viable particle environmental monitoring performed at the time of this batch preparation in the clean room
ISO 5 hood recovered a colony of mold later identified as Engyodontium album by your contract test lab.

OBSERVATION 6
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

AMENDMENT 2

Specifically,

(1) Your firm does not continuously monitor differential pressure between classified rooms or
between classified and unclassified areas. On 05/24/2019 a magnahelic gauge was installed to
permit measurement of the differential pressure between the ISO 7 cleanroom (CR © and the
ISO 8 anteroom (gowning room). There is no gauge to monitor differential pre ure between the
ISO 5 zone and the ISO 7 cleanroom There is no alarm system to alert operators if the
differential pressure cascade is out of specification.

(2) Non-viable particle counts in the ISO 7 cleanrooms are measured

OBSERVATION 7
Aseptic processing areas are deficient in that floors, walls and ceilings are not smooth and/or hard
surfaces that are easily cleanable.

Specifically,

(1) A wall in the hazardous chemical preparation room adjacent to biosafety cabinet BSC appears to be
constructed of cinder block.

(2) The door between the hazardous chemical preparation room and cleanroom is constructed of wood and
painted with epoxy paint.

(3) The door between the unclassified buffer room and ISO 8 anteroom (gowning room) is constructed of wood
and painted with epoxy paint.

(4) On 05/01/2019, I (JEK) observed that the ceiling tiles in cleanroom’ (CR were not flush and were not
caulked.

AMENDMENT 2

OBSERVATION 8
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding temperature and humidity controls.

Specifically, according to the logs used to record temperature, percent relative humidity and differential pressure,
the specification for relative humidity in the cleanrooms is < Such a high level of humidity is not suitable
for cleanroom environments.

Sodium Bicarbonate 8.4% lot SOD032819SVEC was filled on the on 03/28/2019 in cleanroom The
batch record showed that the humidity level at the start of filling was 65%. A review of the pressure, temperature,
and humidity log showed that on 05/13/2019, the relative humidity measured in cleanroom was 68%.

OBSERVATION 9

Equipment and utensils are not cleaned, maintained and sanitized at appropriate intervals to prevent
malfunctions and contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the
drug product.

Specifically,

A. On 5/1/2019, during the processing of the bulk in-process non-sterile orphenadrine citrate 30 mg/ml
for injection lot in cleanroom I (JEK) observed that the bulk
drug substance orphenadrine citrate USP lot. was mixed with sterile water for injection
using in-house reusable depyrogenated glassware beakers) and reusable stir bars. I (JEK)
observed the use of a that was directly placed into the beaker containing the in
process orphenadrine citrate for pH adjustments. This was not dedicated to this product

and may be used with other bulk non-sterile substances. I (JEK) also observed the use of a squeeze
bottle that was not cleaned, sterilized, or depyrogenated that was used to rinse off the

prior to placing it into the beaker containing the in process orphenadrine citrate bulk non-sterile
drug. Both the and the reusable squeeze bottle are potential sources of cross-
contamination.

AMENDMENT 2

B. You are using a strainer and a food grade silicone mat to assist in the amber vial rinses with water
for irrigation and water for injection prior to depyrogenation in accordance with SOP 531 Washing,
Depyrogenating, and Sterilization of Glass Vials, Stoppers, and Caps. This strainer is not cleaned
and was not considered a possible vector for the high number of rejected drug products for white
particles, black particles, hairs, and fibers that your QCU is trending.

OBSERVATION 10

Laboratory controls do not include the establishment of scientifically sound and appropriate sampling
plans and test procedures designed to assure that in-process materials and drug products conform to
appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality and purity.

Specifically, bioburden tests performed by your contract test lab used as the sample
size drawn from a ° _ bulk non-sterile in process batch of morphine sulphate 2 mg/ml lot

to test for bioburden in accordance with <USP 61> as listed on the COA and the
contract test lab SOP 451.1 Microbiological Examination of Nonsterile Products: Microbial
Enumeration Tests. The sample size required by these test methods are or

A. sterile sub-lot (of the bulk non-sterile morphine sulphate 2 mg/ml lot

listed above) of morphine sulphate 2 mg/ml lot MOR032318LMDSC was used to
dose syringes on 3/27/2018 and a sample of syringes containing each
tested positive for microbes using your contract test labs sterility test method SOP 420.2 Use
of for Sterility Testing of Drug Samples which requires a sample size in accordance with

OBSERVATION 11
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for cleaning and disinfecting the room and
equipment to produce aseptic conditions.

AMENDMENT 2
Specifically,
(1) According to procedure 340.7 entitled Cleaning. Use, and Maintenance of the Vial Filling
System, effective 03/11/2019, section 7.3.2 and 7.4.5, the used to fill drug products intended

to be sterile into vials is not cleaned using a sporicidal agent.

(2) The separating the ISO 5 area from the ISO 7 cleanroom (CR are cleaned with
(sporicidal agent) and

(3) Multipacks of sterile wipes are opened in the ISO 7 room, completely unwrapped, and placed in a
PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) open plastic container in the ISO 7 cleanrooms. These wipes
are used to clean the interior of the ISO 5 LAF hoods and the ISO 5 biosafety cabinet. This is a repeat
observation from the 2014 inspection.

OBSERVATION 12
Results of stability testing are not used in determining appropriate storage conditions and expiration
dates.

Specifically,

A. Your firm failed to complete stability studies to support the BUD for drug products intended to be
sterile. For example, stability studies have not been completed for the following drug products which are
labeled to be stored at room temperature:

WO

 

Chlorpromazine HCI 25mg/ml Ilml in a Sml single dose vial 180 days

AMENDMENT 2
Ephedrine Sulfate 10mg/ml preservative free Sml in a 6ml syringe 60 days
ml p

oO + se
Orphenadrine Citrate 30mg/ml Im sterile single dose syringe
inge

 

Succinylcholine Chloride 20mg/ml 10ml single dose s

This is a repeat observation from the 2016 inspection.

B. Your firm reprocessed drug products if these products were not expected to maintain acceptable
potency levels through the end of the established beyond use date (BUD). For example, on 11/09/2018,
Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) 1000mcg/ml solution lot CYA110918NRVA was initially formulated with

of cyanocobalamin in 33000ml and benzyl alcohol) and had a measured
potency of 97.2%. The potency specification is for cyanocobalamin 1000mcg/ml and the
established BUD is 180 days. For lot CYA110918NRVA, the BUD was short-dated to 150 days based on the
expiration date of the benzyl alcohol.

Lot CYA110918NRVA was reprocessed with an additional of cyanocobalamin in an attempt to
obtain a target potency of 100%. The reprocessed lot was named CYA110918NRVAR. According to the
Quality Manager (RM), products with test results near the lower end of the specification range may not
maintain acceptable potency levels throughout the BUD. The products are reformulated to increase the
potency at release to maximize the chance that the product will maintain a potency that meets the established
specification through the end of the BUD.

OBSERVATION 13
There are no written procedures for production and process controls designed to assure that the drug
products have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess.

AMENDMENT 2

Specifically, your firm has not completed product-specific process validation for drug products
including Bupivacaine 0.125%, Succinylcholine Chloride 20mg/ml in Sml or 10m single dose syringes,
and Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B-12) 1000mcg/ml, and Potassium Chloride 2mEq/ml. There is no
assurance that these products are being prepared using a process that consistently delivers products
meeting established specifications.

OBSERVATION 14
You produced highly potent drugs without providing adequate containment, segregation, cleaning of
work surfaces, cleaning of utensils and cleaning of personnel to prevent cross-contamination.

Specifically, highly potent non-sterile drug products containing hormones including testosterone,

estradiol, estriol, and progesterone are prepared in the same hood where non-potent non-sterile
drug products are produced. The hood is cleaned with sterile

batches.

OBSERVATION 15

The container labels of your outsourcing facility's drug products are deficient.

1. The labels of your outsourcing facility’s drug products do not include information required by
section 503B(a)(10)(A). Specifically, the following information is not found on your some of
your drug product labels:

a) the dosage form information is not found on some of your drug product labels.
Examples of your drug product labels that do not contain this information:

Isoproterenol HCL in DSW, 200mcg/50mL
Succinylcholine Chloride 20mg/ml

AMENDMENT 2

b) The National Drug Code number, if available;
Examples of your drug product labels that do not contain this information:

Estriol 1 mg/ml vaginal cream
Estradiol 0.3 mg capsules
Topiramate 25 mg capsules
Ursodiol 100 mg/ml suspension
Gabapentin 100 mg/ml suspension

2. The containers of your outsourcing facility’s drug products does not include information required
by section 503B(a)(10)(B). Specifically, your containers do not include the following
information:

OBSERVATION 16

AMENDMENT 2

1. You compound drugs that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs within the
meaning of sections 503B(a)(5) and 503B(d)(2). Specifically, you compound drug products that:
a) are identical or nearly identical to an approved drug that is not on the drug shortage list in
effect under section 506E at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing; and/ or b)
are not identical or nearly identical to an approved drug, but contain a bulk drug substance that is
also a component of an approved drug, and for which there is no change that produces for an
individual patient a clinical difference, as determined by the prescribing practitioner, between the
compounded drug and the comparable approved drug.

Examples of compounded drug products that are essentially a copy of one or more approved
drugs include:

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM (1} (WE) GBSERVEO:

Observation 1]

You produced highly potent drugs without providing adequate containment, segregation, cleaning of work
surfaces and cleaning of utensils to prevent cross-contamination.

Specifically,

Equipment, work surfaces, and utensils are used for the production of hormonal products as well as non-hormonal
products. Inadequate cross-contamination precautions are established to protect drug products produced on these
shared surfaces. I observed equipment and utensils that had been placed in a cleaned and ready for use
designation. I observed discoloration, staining, and flaking of paint among these cleaned utensils and equipment.
You have failed to deploy an approach to cleaning (dish washer as well as (b) (4) cleaning operations) that is
adequate to remove cleaning agent and product residues, Non-dedicated equipment, utensils, and work surfaces

include the (b) (4) , (b) (4) compounding counters adjacent to the hood, enclosed
wooden drying shelves, glass stirrers, metal spatulas, metal pans, glass mortar and pestle, encapsulation machines,
(b) (4) and mixing blades, (B) (4) troche molds, stir bars, and beakers.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Aseptic processing areas are deficient in that walls are not smooth and/or hard surfaces that are easily
cleanable.

Specifically,

On 7/1/19, I observed cracks and chips on the acrylic view screens of ©) Aiso 5 laminar flow hoods
located in Room 195, where(b) (4) occurs. The crack in Hood™ appeared to be 5-
inches in length spreading horizontally along the view screen above the sterile compounding work
space. A thick and uneven bead of silicone caulk was used to repair the crack on an unknown date —
there were no maintenance records for the repair. The crack and uneven caulk surface is not smooth or
hard and therefore may be difficult to disinfect and sanitize.

In addition, your ISO 5 cleaning procedure (SOP 4.400 DEN) does not address cleaning the inside of the
acrylic view screens and front surfaces, within the ISO 5 laminar air flow space where sterile air
contacts and passes as it flows down to the compounding work space. On 7/8/19, I observed the ISO 5
laminar flow hood cleaning process and noted the inside of the front view screen and front surfaces were
not cleaned prior to compounding.

The following drugs products were compounded in Hood®™ between 4/15/19 and 7/5/19:

ITEM 2

You compound drugs that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs within the meaning
of sections 503B(a)(5) and 503B(d)(2).

Specifically, you compound drug products that:

a) are identical or nearly identical to an approved drug that is not on the drug shortage list in effect
under section 506E at the time of compounding, distribution, and dispensing; or

b) are not identical or nearly identical to an approved drug, but contain a bulk drug substance that is
also a component of an approved drug, and for which there is no change that produces for an
individual patient a clinical difference, as determined by the prescribing practitioner, between the
compounded drug and the comparable approved drug.

Examples of compounded drug products that are essentially a copy of one or more approved drugs
include:

1) Glycopyrrolate 0.4 mg per 2 mL,

2) Neostigmine methylsulfate 4 mg per 4 mL, and

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM I OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be
sterile are not established and followed.

Specifically, on 6/13/2019, during the “Compounding” and “Filling” of Norepinephrine Bitartrate
Injection, USP, Lot Number PROT-000656, | observed poor aseptic technique. For example,

a) During “Compounding” operations in Room 138 (Class 100,000):

i. Operators frequently placed themselves over the open product. They reached directly
across the product to reach equipment on the wall and | observed an operator’s hair,
covered with a hair-net, directly above the open product while she adjusted the mixing
bag.

ii. | The equipment used to monitor (b) (4) was not disinfected before or in-
between measurements, which required the (b) (4) be submerged in the compounded
product and the (6) )to rest on the interior surface of the(b) (4) used for additions.

b) During “Filling” operations in Room 139 (Class 10,000) and Fill Line” Class 100):

i. During needle installation, | noted the operator responsible for passing the needles to
the other operator had his head slightly inside the Class 100 RABS (restricted access
barrier system).

ii. |The operator responsible for transferring the™ trays into the Class 100 (b) (4) was
observed to open the (b) (4) bags, expose the trays in the Class 10,000 environment,
and then use the exposed trays to physically part the(b) (4) surrounding the

AMENDMENT 1

Class 100 (DB) (4) before being taken by the operator within the Class 100 (D) (4) and
placed in the Class 100 transfer cart.

iii. The operator responsible for moving filled, (B) (4) vials into the transfer
trays was observed to rest her wrists on the trays and use her hand to hold the tray at
the Class 100/Class 10,000 interface during operations.

iv. The operator within the Class 100 (b) (4) was not observed to sanitize her hands
frequently, including after handling trays which were outside of the Class 100
conditions. During the entire filling process, | observed her sanitize her hands twice
towards the end of operations and she appeared to use a minimal amount of sterile

(b) (4)

OBSERVATION 2
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically,

a) EM excursions are often not associated with potentially impacted products and lot numbers.
Corrective actions do not include cleaning or verification of cleaning, which is of particular
concern when an investigation identifies a spore-forming organism.

b) The environmental data being captured by (D) (4) ) is not routinely
reviewed, tracked, or trended. *”*” is used to monitor temperature, relative humidity,
differential pressure, and total particles. The system is only reviewed when alarms trigger due
to an excursion event for differential pressure, temperature, and relative humidity.

i. | Per SOP-OP-000021, Monitoring of Differential Pressures for Cleanroom Areas, a (©) @)
report will be printed and attached to each batch record for filling activities. This is not

AMENDMENT 1

being performed. No similar procedures exist which require temperature and relative
humidity to be printed, reviewed, and attached to applicable batch records.

c) Personnel do not always use best practices during finger-plating. On 6/13/2019, | observed
numerous operators using quick, light touches on the media.

d) Gowning rooms are only being monitored for production activities if they are nearest the fill
room in use (either Room 139 or Room 161). No practice or procedure is in place to preclude
personnel from using either gowning room for entry to either fill room. Additionally, some
products use rooms which are supported by both gowning rooms, such as Erythromycin
Lactobionate, which is aseptically filled in Room 139 and (b) (4) __ in (b) (4) (Room
165).

e) EM sampling locations are not always representative of the air to which the vials and product
are exposed. On 6/13/2019, | observed the settling plate within Fill Line © yositioned
underneath the vial (Db) (4)

f) Unique sampling locations have not been established for the(®) (4) Class 100 transfer carts used
for aseptically transporting (b) (4) vials in the Michelle facility. (©) (4)new carts
started being used on 3/1/2019. The same sample ID used for the original cart is being used for
all carts and the unique cart asset number is input into the notes within the system. Individual
cart results cannot be tracked and trended by the system without unique sample IDs.

OBSERVATION 3
Procedures designed to prevent microbiological contamination of drug products purporting to be
sterile did not include adequate validation of the aseptic process.

Specifically,
a) During a media fill for Protocol 2018-PQ-053, an incubated vial exhibited growth and was
inappropriately reclassified as non-integral, invalidating the positive result. The vial was part of

AMENDMENT 1

Lot XMHA1806 and had been segregated as an integral reject prior to incubation due to it
missing an over-seal but having a fully-seated stopper. The investigation found no obvious
breach in the vial integrity yet concludes the vial should not have been included as an integral
reject because it was missing its over-seal. The growth was not identified due to its
reclassification. The investigation lacks scientific justification to invalidate the growth observed
during the media fill.

b) Static and dynamic smoke studies have not been performed in Class 100 Rooms 165 and 139L
showing air movement during (b) (4) loading activities.

OBSERVATION 4
Drug product containers and closures were not sterilized and processed to remove pyrogenic
properties to assure that they are suitable for their intended use.

Specifically, the IV bags used for Sodium Chloride 0.9% injection, a() (4) product, are not
purchased or rendered sterile, pyrogen-free, or particle-free.

OBSERVATION 5
There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy whether or not the batch has been
already distributed.

Specifically, during review of quality investigations, numerous concerns were observed. For example,
regarding Sodium Bicarbonate (84 mg/mL), Lot BMHG1802, a 503B product which was “Compounded”
on 7/31/2018:

AMENDMENT 1

a) DEV-00238 was initiated on 7/31/2018 due to 4 alert and action level alarms for pum
particulates during the first (D) (4) of filling, though thel®) @) records indicate the alarms were
triggered for both™® um and” im sized particles. Batch documentation indicates there were
numerous alarms but does not provide the approximate time every alarm sounded nor the
activity which was being performed, if any, at the time of each alarm. Additionally, operators
noticed a drip from(b) (4 Ineedles, specifically, needle(®) (4)when the filler was stopped. It states
there was no drip during production. There is no indication the issue was resolved and the
aerosolization of dried product due to the fill-needles dripping was not considered as part of
the investigation.

b) DEV-00564 was initiated on 1/2/2019 due to active and inactive ingredient data missing from
the carton labeling. The investigation does not identify how much product was distributed, if
any, whether the missing information was only on the carton or also on the vial label, and
whether the batch was reworked.

c) DEV-00808 was initiated on 3/26/2019 for OOT particulate test results during stability testing.
The OOT findings were confirmed and the shelf life was shortened from 24 months to 18
months. There is no indication that the particulates were the result of a compound coming out
of solution. The investigation does not include an assessment of DEV-00238, which was
initiated for high particulates during filling. Additionally, during OOT investigative testing, an
OOS particulate level was identified for 1 counts for Sodium Bicarbonate, Lot BMHG1802.
No actions were taken in response to this OOS finding.

OBSERVATION 6
Batch production and control records do not include complete information relating to the production
and control of each batch.

Specifically,

AMENDMENT 1

a) During review of the batch documentation for Erythromycin Lactobionate (500 mg/vial), 20 mL
vial, ©) @ batch, Lot CMHG1822, “Compounded” on 7/19/2018, which has not been released, |
noted the following:

i. During “Compounding” Step the operators did not follow the recommended
instructions for the addition of the erythromycin base, an API, by adding it in” “divisions
with a (b) (4) stir time for each division. The recommended method for API addition
would result in a minimum of (D) (4) _ and this batch had the erythromycin added over
(b) (4) Additionally, later in this step, the mix start- and end-time are recorded, but
there is no verification the mix time does not exceed the (b) (4) maximum mixing
time specified in bold within the instructions.

ii. | There is no verification the unfiltered, bulk solution was maintained at less than © @) prior
to being b) (4 Jinto the holding bag/vessel. Per the manufacturing specification, this is a
temperature sensitive product and it can be held up to” hours prior to transfer provided

(b) (4)

it is (D) (4) , held under ()@), and under (b) (4) . There is no data for
bulk product temperature after its Q.S. to final weight at approximately(D) (4)on 7/25/18.
(b) (4) began at (D) (4)on 7/25/18.

iii. | During a routine vial fill-weight check, a vial was taken from Tray 6 and was found to have
a weight of 8.57 g. The reject limit for low fill-weight is (b) (4) g. No actions were taken in
response to this result. The previous fill-weights were taken from Tray 3 and the
subsequent fill-weights were taken from Tray 9. Each tray holds somewhere between © @
and @vials, meaning potentially hundreds of vials had unidentified low fill-weights. This
is a(b) (4) product making identification of impacted vials only possible for gross
under- or over-fills during visual inspection.

iv. The interventions record for this batch indicates there were fallen vials with product in
them during the filling of vials loaded in Tray 8 and Tray 20. There is no documentation
indicating cleaning occurred, how long the Class 100 RABS was open during cleaning, or
that vials were cleared from the line in response to a cleaning intervention.

AMENDMENT 1

b) On 6/13/2019, during the filling of Norepinephrine Bitartrate Injection, USP, Lot Number PROT-
000656, | observed numerous interventions into the Class 100 RABS and noted there was no
documentation of the interventions made in the record. Toward the end of the batch, | noted a
total of 2 entries into the RABS had been documented. | had seen at least 10 different entries
for stopper loading, stopper jam clearing, and vial jam clearing.

OBSERVATION 7
Equipment and utensils are not maintained at appropriate intervals to prevent malfunctions and
contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product.

Specifically, the Class 100 (b) (4) Exela Asset OP4015.018, used to provide ISO 5 grade air during
(b) (4) vial transfer, has not been fully certified. The (D) (4) also referred to as the
(b) (4) or the Portable Class 5 Enclosure, has failed for (©) @)

testing during the previous two certifications, performed in August 2018 and February
2019. The certification report indicates the acceptance criteria is NLT OM) air changes per hour. The
results were 172 air changes per hour and 223 air changes per hour, respectively.

Additionally, SOP-VA-000002, Certification of HEPA Filters, indicates the(b) (4) should be tested per the
(b) (4) test with an acceptance criterium of (BD) (4) _ per minute at (D) (4) from the
filter face. The previous two certifications were performed for air changes per hour.

The test failures and use of the incorrect test criteria were not identified. Both certification reports

were reviewed and signed by Exela personnel.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM WE OBSERVED:
OBSERVATION 1
Personnel engaged in aseptic processing were observed wearing non-sterile gloves,

Specifically, your firm failed to utilize sterile gloves during the preparation of all sterile drug products (indicated
for sterile injection). For example, on 6/24/19, your Pharmacist stated that no sterile gloves were used during the

preparation of the (>) ©) » lot (ted) which was used to produce

finished radiological drug product, Mertiatide-Tc99m LEU, lot #K-20190624-007.

OBSERVATION 2
Sporicidal agents were not used in your facility's cleanrooms and/or [SO 5 classified aseptic processing
area.

Specifically, your firm's Pharmacist stated he only uses [© ~ — (non-sterile surface disinfectant and
decontaminant cleaner) and non-sterile — within your classified ISO 3-LAFH. No

sporicidal agent is used,

 

OBSERVATION 3
Your facility design allowed the influx of poor quality air into a higher classified area.

Specifically,

a. Your firm's classified ISO-3 LAFH (lJ hoods defined as Hood) and Hood!) are located within the
classified [SO-8 Pharmacy Area. Your firm failed to demonstrate through smoke studies that an influx of

 

VME Teeny (es BF SHWE WEDD w EERE, TUS VWAMTORSEW ERT NT SOE DE SS UOUESEEER BEA PA WeNONOwESYED WS CSwEtEw em ED

products. In addition, your firm's Pharmacist stated the 0) -classified ISO-3 LAFH are shut off
overnight and prior to resuming production activities only wipes down the hoods with non-sterile 7)

b. Your firm failed to monitor the differential pressure between areas with different air classifications (such
as the classified ISO-8 Pharmacy Area to the unclassified gowning room) prior or during sterile drug
production.

c. The set-up of the classified ISO-8 Pharmacy Area can potentially increase particulate counts. For
example, the room contains a refrigerator adjacent to the classified ISO-3 LAFH (Hood “a table top fan
was observed on the counter between Hood and the (9) <)) | Hood (used for rocessing), air
conditioning vents (non-HEPA) were observed in close proximity to Hood and Hood iene all hoods
were observed cluttered containing supplies and equipment.

OBSERVATION 4
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically, your firm lacked environmental monitoring (EM) procedures and documentation to demonstrate that
EM was conducted during sterile processing operations. For example, your firm’s President/Pharmacist stated

that on 6/24/19, no EM was conducted during the)» of (2) RG) (b) (4) \

did not include adequate validation of the aseptic process.

Specifically, your firm failed to conduct media fills that closely simulate aseptic production operations
incorporating, as appropriate, worst-case activities and conditions that provide a challenge to aseptic
operations. For example, according to your firm's President/Pharmacist your firm) — e(()C3)

OBSERVATION 6
Each batch of drug product purporting to be sterile is not laboratory tested to determine conformance to
such requirements.

Specifically, on 06/24/2019, your firm filled Rx #5 ©) for Mertiatide-Tc99m LEU (sterile

injectable), lot #K-20190624-007 (8.539 mCi, Quantity: ) Volume: 0.74mL), Use By D/T: 06/25/2019,
from the |=) =) contained in the sterile tube, but failed to
test the finished drug product for sterility. According to your firm's President/Owner, sterility testing is

not being conducted on the finished product, Mertiatide when ©) SEY) are being
used.
OBSERVATION 7

There are no written procedures for production and process controls designed to assure that the drug
products have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess.

(RC) (amounts were not weighed or verified) consistently meets predetermined
specifications established by the manufacturer.

OBSERVATION 8
Each component is not tested for conformity with all appropriate written specifications for purity,
strength, and quality.

Specifically, your firm's President/Pharmacist stated he was receiving (Mertiatide) from an
alternate distribution channel (unknown source); however, your firm failed to ensure through
appropriate analytical testing or documentation from the manufacturer that the’~ —_ purchased meets
specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity. According to your firm’s Kit Information
Report, your firm used these components to produce and dispense the following number of finished drug
product units of Mertiatide-Tc99m LEU (sterile injectable) within 2019:

units in January 2019,
units in February 2019,
units in March 2019,
units in April 2019,
units in May 2019.

 

OBSERVATION 9

Testing and release of drug product for distribution do not include appropriate laboratory determination
of satisfactory conformance to the final specifications and identity and strength of each active ingredient
prior to release.

Specifically, according to your firm's President/Pharmacist, potency testing of the active ingredient has not been
conducted by your firm for the finished radiological drug product, Mertiatide-Tc99m LEU, which utilized
(OVUM fom an alternate distribution channel (unknown source)

OBSERVATION 10
There is no written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products.

Specifically, according to your firm’s President/Pharmacist your firm applies the same expiration date of

the original drug product to the ((s)) (4) | — without having any data to support the stability of
this product after further manipulations.

In addition, on 6/24/19 your firm filled Rx #4 for Mertiatide-Tc99m LEU (sterile injectable), lot
#K-20190624-007 (8.539 mCi, Quantity: actor: 0.74mL), and assigned a Use by Date of
06/25/2019 (24 hours); however a manufacturer's product insert found within the Pharmacy states the
technetium Tce 99m mertiatide preparation must be used within’ of preparation. Your firm
lacked data to support this product retains the required activity for 24-hours.

 

OBSERVATION 11
Records associated with drug product components, containers, closures, labeling. production, control
and distribution and within the retention pane for such records, were not made readily available for
authorized inspection.

 

Specifically, your firm failed to provide complete documentation including a Certificate of Analysis

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Equipment and utensils are not cleaned and maintained at appropriate intervals to prevent that would
alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product.

Specifically, :
A) On 6/12/19 during a walkthrough of your firm’s aseptic pgocessing areas, I observed in (Bb) (4)
laminar flow hood (Equipment ID#FSS-1050) cleanroom suite _a brown/black residue on the inside of

the LFH bottom left (b) (4) panel between the panel and the metal bench table lip edge.
(Photograph taken) Aseptic processing of Glycopyrrolate 0.2mg/ml injection 5 ml syringes,
batch#(b) (4) _ was being aseptically filled at this time.

B) On 6/12/19 during a walkthrough of your firm’s aseptic processing areas, I observed in (b) (4)
laminar flow hood (Equipment ID# FSS-1053) cleanroom suite) cracked (b) (4) side panels
from the overtightening of two connecting screws. In the cracking area around the screws a brown
residue was observed. (Photograph taken) Aseptic processing of Succinylcholine chloride injection
20mg/ml batch# (b) (4) was being aseptically filled at the time.

OBSERVATION 2
Testing and release of drug product for distribution do not include appropriate laboratory determination
of satisfactory conformance to the final specifications prior to release.

Specifically,
There is no testing of the preservative content in the injectable drug products at time of release or during
beyond use dating studies. The following injectable solutions contain preservatives:

Succinylcholine Chloride 20mg/ml injection contains methylparaben as a preservative
Neostigmine Methylsulfate 1mg/ml injection contains phenol as a preservative
Glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg/ml injection contains benzyl alcohol as a preservative

Sodium citrate 4% solution contains (Db) (4) as a preservative

Sodium citrate 4%/Gentamicin 320 mcg/ml contains (b) (4) as a preservative
Ketamine 50 mg/ml contains benzethonium chloride as a preservative

OBSERVATION 3
Protective apparel is not worn as necessary to protect drug products from contamination.

Specifically,

On 6/12/19 and again on 6/13/19, I observed aseptic operators in the clean room suites
respectively; wearing a goggle type in the ISO 5 (b) (4) laminar flow hood which contained
numerous holes (approximately 50) for direct venting. Aseptic operators were at the time performing
aseptic filling for sodium thiosulfate in 50 ml vials (Suite and a development batch for morphine 3ml
syringes.

(b) (4) andi

OBSERVATION 4
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically,

The monitoring for non-viable particulates is not located in close proximity to the aseptic operator
located on the ® “side of the laminar flow hood performing aseptic manipulations. The particle counter
is located on the (b) (4) of the (b) (4) laminar flow hood. Two operators work
simultaneously on the right and left side of the bench. The non-viable particle counter position is not in
close proximity of the aseptic manipulations for the aseptic technician on the side of the laminar
flow hood.

OBSERVATION 5
The responsibilities and procedures applicable to the quality control unit are not fully followed.

Specifically,

Media Fill study FSS 2018-030 (11/2018) for the 10 ml syringe, 5 ml fill does not contain information results of
the incubated ©) @) units and the conclusionary results of the media fill. There is no final report describing study
results, if positive units were found and if the media fill met the protocol acceptance criteria.

OBSERVATION 6
There is a failure to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and the failure of a batch or any of
its components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has been already distributed.

Specifically,

Investigations are not complete and do not always include a full investigation. Out of specification
investigations do not include a review of the manufacturing process as required by your SOP 1.040.FSS,
revision 2.0.

For example, the following OOS investigations were incomplete:

a) Neostigmine methylsulfate lot# C74-00010275 compounded on 4/30/19, Beyond Use Date 9/27/2019
received an OOS for assay with a result of 115.6% (limits (b) (4)>). No assignable root cause in the
initial lab investigation. The original sample vial was (B) (4) and a revial of the original sample prep
were performed; results were 115.2% and 115.5%, respectively. This confirms the original OOS. A
triplicate retest was performed along with a 4"" confirmatory test. All within specifications (b) (4)

(b) (4) %. A (b) (4) test was applied and considered the original result an outlier. The
original result was invalidated. There was no full investigation or review of the compounding
formulation records and process. Batch was released.

b) Rocuronium Bromide 10 mg/ml lot# C274-000009195 compounded on 2/22/19, Beyond Use Date
8/21/2019 received an OOS for assay with a result of 84.5% (limits (b) (4)°%). No assignable root cause

in the initial lab investigation. The original sample vial was (b) (4) and a revial of the original sample
prep were performed; results were 90.5% and 108.1%, respectively. A triplicate retest was performed
along with a 4™ confirmatory test. All within specifications: (B) (4) %_ The root cause
was an unknown sample error. There was no full investigation or review of the compounding
formulation records and process. Batch was released.

c) Glycopyrrolate 0.2mg/ml lot#C274-000006719 compounded on 9/5/18, Beyond Use Date 2/2/2019
received an OOS for assay with a result of 86.2% (limits (b) (4)%). No assignable root cause in the
initial lab investigation. The original sample vial was (b) (4) and a revial of the original sample prep
were performed: results were 86.3% and 86.9%, respectively. Two retests and three resamples were
performed. All within specifications: (b) (4) The root cause was an
unknown sample error. There was no full investigation or review of the compounding formulation
records and process. Batch was released.

d) Sodium Thiosulfate 25% lot# C274-000010672 compounded on 5/23/19, Beyond Use Date 8/21/2019
received an OOS for endotoxins with a result of 4.0301 EU/ml limits are (6) (4) EU/ml. Preliminary
investigation could not assign a cause to the OOS. Retesting was performed in triplicate by (b) (4)
analyst. The results were within specifications. The root cause was “sample prep error or it is likely the
product sample well was contaminated”. There was no full investigation or review of the compounding
formulation records and process. Batch was released.

e) Customer complaint 0119-01 initiated on January 2, 2019 reported one of the Succinylcholine
Chloride syringes lot C274-000007865 did not have a label. There is no documentation of the
investigation to the complaint.

DURING AN INSPECTION OF YOUR FIRM | OBSERVED:

OBSERVATION 1

Each batch of drug product purporting to be sterile is not laboratory tested to determine conformance to
such requirements.

Specifically, your Pharmacist stated that no sterility testing is conducted for the following radiological
and nuclear injectable drug products:

a. Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) kits, 1.09mg (b) (4) , assigned 45 days BUD).
b. Sodium Thiosulfate Anhydrous (Sulfur Colloid) Kits, 1.0mL (b) (4) , assigned 45

Specifically,
a. Your firm's Pharmacist stated he conducts (b) (4) on the (b) (4)
(b) (4)

(b) ie but is unsure of the specific allowable(b) (4) requirement, therefore cannot confirm if the

c. Media fills were not performed that closely simulate aseptic production operations incorporating,
as appropriate, worst-case activities and conditions that provide a challenge to aseptic operations.
Your firm can produce(b) (4) of DTPA, 10mg during routine operations, but your media fill
only covers (b) (4) and doesn’t replicate the entire process, which includes (b) (4)

OBSERVATION 3
Aseptic processing areas are deficient regarding the system for monitoring environmental conditions.

Specifically,

a. Your Pharmacist stated that Environmental Monitoring (surface and non-viable air) is performed
after cleaning and not after production of drug products within the ISO-5 aseptic processing
areas therefore providing unreliable results.

b. On 5/6/19, I observed expired (b) (4) —___ exp.: 4/15/19) being used for

d. Your firm's Pharmacist stated he only uses (b) (4) (non-sterile surface disinfectant and
decontaminant cleaner) and (b) (4) within the ISO 5-LAFH. No sporicidal agent is
used.

e. On 5/7/19, cleaning operations were observed prior to drug production and the Pharmacist was
observed spraying the (b) (4) and (b) (4) onto a non-sterile wipe to clean the ISO 5
LAFH.

f. For the floors, walls and ceilings of the clean room, the firm uses ©)@ (non-sterile neutral
disinfectant cleaner) and (b) (4) (non-sterile, non-sporicidal disinfectant solution).

OBSERVATION 4
Equipment and utensils are not cleaned, maintained and sanitized at appropriate intervals to prevent
contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product.

Specifically, on 5/7/19, during the aseptic production of Pyrophosphate Kit, lot #050719PYP, Exp:5/1/2020:

a. Your firm's ISO 5-LAFH was observed to contain visible signs of rust and deterioration of the working

Pyrophosphate Kit, lot #050719PYP, Exp:5/1/2020 (4 out of ""vials remained in a(b) 4 state).
Your Pharmacist stated this incident has occurred a few times in the past with other drug
products and the vials were discarded while the remainder of the lot was shipped. No
investigations were ever conducted.

b. On 5/13/19, I observed two colonies (alert level: cfu) of growth on the (b) (4) (after””
days of incubation at” © degrees Celsius), from the surface sample taken after the completion of
the (b) (4) for PYP, lot #050719PYP, exp: 5/1/2020. No investigation was
conducted.
