# Exploratory Analysis

What proportion of FDA Inspections in 2019 were Center for Drug Evaluation and Radiological Health?

```{r}
blank_theme <- theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold")
  )

classifications %>%
  group_by(Center) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    Inspections = n()
  ) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x = "", y = Inspections, fill = Center), stat = "identity") + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "CBER" = "grey95",
    "CDER" = "firebrick",
    "CDRH" = "grey85",
    "CFSAN" = "grey75",
    "CTP" = "grey65",
    "CVM" = "grey55"
  )) +

```

Of the CDER Inspections, what was the distribution of Inspection Classifications?

What is the distribution of inspections per capita by state? Make a heatmap of America.

```{r}
classifications %>%
  filter(Center == "CDER",
         `Project Area` == "Drug Quality Assurance",
         !is.na(State)) %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    Inspections = n()
  )
```

What is the distribution of Classifications by State?

What months of the year is the agency most likely to perform an inspection? Make a bar graph with fill = classification. Does this distribution look different in the region which Vermont belongs to?

```{r}
classifications %>%
  filter(Center == "CDER",
         `Project Area` == "Drug Quality Assurance",
         !is.na(State),

  group_by(month) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(
    count = n(),
    NAI = sum(Classification == "NAI"),
    VAI = sum(Classification == "VAI"),
    OAI = sum(Classification == "OAI"),

  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "YlOrRd", direction = -1) + 
  labs(
    title = "FDA Audits in the New England Area are less frequent in the summer",
    subtitle = "Classification of 'Offical Action Indicated' most common in March and August",
